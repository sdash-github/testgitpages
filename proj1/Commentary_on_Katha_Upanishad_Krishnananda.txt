SHANTI MANTRA
Every Upanishad commences with a prayer, the Shanti
Mantra; a formula for the invocation of peace, chanted at
the beginning and close of study. The Shanti Mantra of the
Katha Upanishad reads:
auṁ saha nāvavatu, saha nau bhunaktu, saha vīryam
karavāvahai; tejasvi nāv adhītam astu: mā vidviṣāvahai; auṁ
śāntih, śāntih, śāntih.

It means that there should be proper attunement
of spirit between the Guru and disciple before they begin
the study, for only then will the teaching be fruitful:
“May we both be protected. May both of us be taken care
of properly. May we study together. May our teaching
and learning be resplendent. May there be no
misunderstanding between us. May there be no discord
of any kind. May there be peace, may there be peace,
may there be peace.” Thrice peace; we have three
kinds of troubles, called tapatraya: internally, physical
ones; externally, from outside beings; and from above,
given by the gods. May all these cease.

INTRODUCTION
The Bhagavadgita is a part of the Mahabharata epic.
The purpose of this epic is to spread esoteric knowledge to
the public—a knowledge which is difficult to get. The
Mahabharata is a Smriti, which implies an easy rendering of
a complex and esoteric text. Smriti is a text which is
written, and not revealed, like the Shruti is. The Vedas are a
revealed text and not written by any author.
As mentioned in one of the Gita Mahatmya verses, the
Bhagavadgita is the essence of the Upanishads. Why was it
necessary to give the essence? Because Kaliyuga was about
to dawn, and truths which could be understood before now
needed elaborate explanations, as people’s minds had
become unfit to understand the subtleties of the
ShrutisHence, it is profitable to behold the esoteric and
mystical meaning of the Bhagavadgita. A truth not to be
given to the masses, but only to initiated disciples. It is not
that knowledge is to be hidden, but it should be avoided
being given into wrong hands.
There is a scripture similar to the Bhagavadgita in many
respects, called the Katha Upanishad, the one from which
the Bhagavadgita-teachings are believed by many to have
been drawn. If the Bhagavadgita is a conversation between
Sri Krishna and Arjuna, placed in the context of the
historical event of the Mahabharata war, the Katha
Upanishad is a conversation between Yama and
Nachiketas. Just as we have the confusion of Arjuna’s mind
in the beginning of the Bhagavadgita, we find intense
aspiration on the part of Nachiketas in the beginning of the
Kathopanishad. There are four important stages in its
6

teaching, even as the eighteen chapters of the Bhagavadgita
reveal the stages of the sadhaka’s evolution.
The Katha is magnificent in its poetic beauty and
mystical value. It touches the vital points of spirituality
without beating about the bush. The verses or mantras are
statements of human consciousness in its higher reaches of
the spirit. This Upanishad takes an anecdote for its
background. It occurs in the Taittiriya Brahmana portion of
the Vedas which precedes the Kathopanishad:
Vajasravasa Gautama performed a sacrifice called
Sarvavedas or Sarvadakshina, a sacrifice in which one is
supposed to offer everything he has, without exception;
hence its name Sarvadakshina. It is a preparation for the
last stage of spiritual life. However, he was not really ready
for it. He wanted to offer only things which were not useful,
thus following the letter of law, but losing the spirit behind
it. He had a young son, Nachiketas by name, who clearly
saw the two defects in the sacrifice: the giving of weak and
barren cows, and the father’s ignorance of the fact that the
son, too, was to be offered. “Joyless,” said the boy, “are the
regions to which he goes who offers such sacrifices!” thus
irritating his father. And he asked him: “To whom are you
going to offer me?” He repeated this question thrice, and
the displeased Gautama answered angrily: “To death I send
you!”
Here ends the outline of the story, and now we have the
real beginning of the Upanishad—a direct teaching to the
spiritual aspirant.
The Vedas contain four sections: the mantra portion
called the Samhitas; the ritualistic portion called the
Brahmanas (external sacrifice to the chanting of the
7

Samhitas); the internal ways of sacrifice, the Aranyakas—
which can also be called internal Brahmanas—which are
sacrifices without involving materials; and the endportion
of the Vedas, the Upanishads, also known as Vedanta.

CHAPTER 1
SECTION 1 – NACHIKETAS’ POSITION
Prologue: Nachiketas Devoted to Death
uśan ha vai vājaśravasaḥ sarva-vedasaṁ dadau:
tasya ha naciketā nāma putra āsa. (1)

“Desiring heavenly enjoyment, Gautama performed a
sacrifice called sarva dakshina. He had a son, Nachiketas,
very thoughtful and discriminative.”
Desiring did he perform the sacrifice. The intention
behind it was to gain heavenly pleasure. This represents the
purely exoteric aspect of religion, the outward form of
devotion and faith as different from the internal spirit or
the esoteric significance of practice. While Gautama
represents the outer form of religion, Nachiketas
symbolises the inner spirit. The former attitude expects
something from every religious act: ‘What shall I get from
my pilgrimage, from a sacred bath, etc.?’ These are the
questions of this mind. ‘If I will not get something, I will
not be religious’. This attitude exhibits a commercial
attitude leading to bigotry. While the outer form is
necessary—like the legs of a person who can walk with
them but needs a head to think with—it is inadequate by
itself. The spirit should go hand in hand with the form. So,
religion is different from spirituality, though it is very
necessary. The outer form of worship should be an
expression of inner surrender, and not a mere symbol. This
is what Gautama’s sacrifice lacked. Desiring something he
performed the sacrifice, but did not part with everything he
9

had, as was required by its spirit. When this dakshina was
given by him, Nachiketas thought to himself:
taṁ ha kumāraṁ santaṁ dakṣiṇāsu nīyamānāsu śraddhāviveśa, so’manyata. (2)

Is this religion? He was a great spiritual example for all
times to come, though his question was impertinent. He
thought: “What is this sacrifice?”
pītodakā jagdha-tṛṇā dugdhadohā nirindriyāḥ
anandā nāma te lokās tān sa gacchata tā dadat. (3)

He wants the pleasure of this world, so he did not part
with the good cows; and he also wants the pleasure in the
other world, so he gives (useless) cows. It is a poor sacrifice,
because he offers that which is unworthy.
sa hovāca pitaram, tāta kasmai māṁ dāsyasīti;
dvitīyaṁ tṛtīyam; taṁ hovāca: mṛtyave tvā dadāmīti. (4)

In the fourth mantra, the teaching proper commences
with: sa hovaca pitaram... “To whom do you propose to
offer me?” The ‘me’ represents also the self of Gautama. If it
is offering all, sarvadakshina, then it should include not
only what belongs to one, but also his own self. Three times
asked Nachiketas this question. The answer was, “Unto
death I offer you.” Though this was the answer to the son, it
mystically means the death of the soul.
Three times asked the boy, implying the ‘I’ has to be
given up in three stages, not at once. The first one is the
physical offering, followed by the subtle and the causal,
because we are this threefold being; we can also call it
conscious, subconscious and unconscious. We are citizens
of three worlds; this is brought out when one takes sanyasa.
The seeker takes an oath that he renounces the pleasures of
10

this world, of the astral world and of the heavens—all the
three worlds. The offering has to be total and all-inclusive.
Psychologists call this condition introversion, and it is selfabnegation in ethics. So Nachiketas’ thrice-repeated
question has spiritual import of the necessary threefold
offering of every seeker. This is like dying, for who can offer
his whole being to God? We cannot even offer our physical
possessions. To offer the mind and the subconscious is
veritable death. The threefold personality has to pass
through veritable death, and this is rebirth, as it were, into
the awakening of the spirit. It is rebirth in the spirit, and
death to all that is physical. “Let the ‘me’ be offered in its
threefold significance!” is the outer and inner meaning of
the mantra.
bahῡnām emi prathamaḥ, bahῡnām emi madhyamaḥ;
kiṁ svid yamasya kartavyam yan mayādya kariṣyati. (5)

It is the darkness of not-knowing that is spiritual death.
Nachiketas thought: “What is the business of Yama that is
being achieved through me? Why should I go to him? I
have served my father well. I may be the first or at least the
next, but not the worst. What is the intention of his offering
me to Yama?”
anupaśya yathā pῡrve pratipaśya tathāpare,
sasyam iva martyaḥ pacyate sasyam ivajāyate punaḥ. (6)

“Well, whatever you have said is all right,” he said to
Gautama, and added: “Don’t withdraw your words.
Remember our ancestors who have adhered to truth always.
Let it be so, although it may be unpleasant. Though you
might have unwittingly, in anger, said it, don’t take it back.
Like a corn in the field does a human being grow and fall:
11

the seed grows only to fall and falls only to grow. So is
human life; and if I pass away, let there be no grief, because
birth and death are only correlatives.”
The Upanishad does not mention what happened to
Nachiketas or Gautama after this conversation. The
Taittiriya Brahmana says that the boy went to the hall of
Yama, either due to the words of Gautama or by the power
of his own tapas.
Nachiketas in the House of Death
vaiśvānaraḥ praviśaty atithir brāhmaṇo gṛhān:
tasyaitāṁ śāntiṁ kurvanti, hara vaivasvatodakam. (7)

When Nachiketas reached the abode of Yama, Lord
Yama was not there. This is a very important stage in the
seeker’s life: when the disciple goes to the Guru, the latter
often does not welcome him, but shows indifference.
Suka went to Janaka’s court and was asked to wait.
There was no warm reception; he was not told when the
Guru would be available or even if he would be available at
all— but instead, great temptations were presented to him.
Yama came after three days and, during that time,
Nachiketas waited patiently. In contrast to Suka, we do not
know what he was thinking or doing. Another important
truth is taught here: that a guest should be honoured. A
guest who comes of his own accord, an atithi—one who
comes without a particular tithi or day—is regarded as God.
It is the universal Soul that presents Itself as the guest. One
who comes to you, expecting help, is to be regarded as God
Himself; such a one is to be propitiated. Such a guest, if
turned out, takes away all the merits of that person who is
inhospitable.
12

āśā-pratīkṣe saṁgataṁ sῡnṛtāṁ ceṣṭāpῡrte putra-paśῡṁś ca
sarvān
etad vṛṅkte puruṣasyālpamedhaso yasyānaśnan vasati
brāhmaṇo gṛhe. (8)

“Of the person in whose house a guest starves, is not
being given, even when asked for; of that person, the guest
goes away taking all virtues and merits, and also the lives of
all his children and cows; all these are destroyed.”
When God is turned out of a house, anything can
happen, is what is suggested by this. There is a beautiful
story in the Chhandogya Upanishad, of a poor man who
went for alms. When people refused him, he asked: “Do
you know to whom you are refusing to give? To the
Universal Prana!” They were frightened to hear this, and
called him back and offered alms. The spiritual man is a
godly man; a saint is a divine person. And hence, the atithi
who is coming either to bless you or to test you may go
away, taking everything of yours, if you turn a deaf ear to
him.
When Yama returned to his abode, his courtiers told
him: “Lord, a guest has come; an uninvited guest. Who is
more important than he! He is God who has come as the
universal fire.” Yama answered: “Please him. Let him not
burn; give him water!”
When Yama presents himself before Nachiketas, the
spirit of the Upanishad rises to great intensity.
Three Boons Offered to Nachiketas
tisro rātrīr yād avatsīr gṛhe me’naśnan brahman atitthir
namasyaḥ.
namaste’ṡtu brahman; svasti me’stu tasmāt prati trīn varān
vṛṇīṣva. (9)
13

Yama says to Nachiketas: “O Brahmana, you have
fasted in my house for three nights. I make obeisance to
you! Ask from me three boons, for the three nights you
starved here, so that I may be blessed and do not incur the
sin of not giving to my guest. May auspiciousness be mine!”
The soul that ascends to God has to break three knots—
the knots of avidya, kama and karma, corresponding to the
three bodies: sthula, sukshma and karana. Karma is the
character of the physical body, kama of the subtle body,
and avidya of the causal. These three are like impregnable
fortresses; hard is it to penetrate them! They are called the
tripura of the three demons of ignorance, desire and action.
The only way of liberating oneself from them is fasting.
They are veritable nights; they are darkness.
Three boons will be bestowed in accordance with these
three fasts of the physical, subtle and causal realms. Eating
is a great bondage which can do and undo things. When
you take food of any particular realm or any person, you
are bound and obliged to them. On all these levels of being,
there are temptations of various kinds. The free person is he
who does not get bound by them, by not accepting gifts.
When you take something from someone, you must return
it to him, which obligation brings you rebirth. If you have
not taken anything, you need not come back. Thus, the
three nights represent the breaking of the three knots of
avidya, kama and karma. These fasts bring great
advantages. The first is universal renown. Even if you starve
for twenty-one days, your name appears in newspapers and
you become a world-celebrity; this is only a gross form of
starvation. But accepting nothing which does not really
belong to, or is not really needed by you, is a great tapas.
14

The spiritual seeker often gets more than even
householders. This is a temptation which prevents a soul
from progressing. So, accept not anything in the physical,
subtle and causal realms! But the higher you go, the deeper
are the temptations. The physical ones are weaker than the
higher ones which are more powerful and more difficult to
overcome. Yama, as the universal night, offers three boons
for the three nights of fasting observed by Nachiketas.
Nachiketas’s First Wish: Return to an Appeased
Father on Earth
śānta-saṁkalpaḥ sumanā yathā syād vīta-manyur gautamo
mābhi mṛtyo,
tvat-prasṛṣṭam mābhivadet-pratīta, etat trayāṇām
prathamaṁ varaṁ vṛṇe. (10)

“As the first gift, O Lord, offer this to me: when I
return, released by you to the world of my father, may he
receive me with a calm mind, free from anger, recognising
me as I have been before; not thinking that I am dead and
returning.”
This implies that Nachiketas must return, and when
returned, should be recognised. He wants normal
circumstances to prevail when he returns. This is the result
of fasting for one night: one becomes normal in a spiritual
sense, and the world from which the soul rose accepts it
truly. Many believe this verse to mean that by the power of
fasting, austerity etc., a seeker can gain world-renown; you
will wield a power which the world will recognise. This is a
boon, but also a temptation of which one has to be
cautious. A person, who was just a part of the world, now
becomes a world figure. Every seeker will have to pass
15

through this stage, and to each one it will come in a
different shape.
To give an example, there was a mahatma in the regions
above Gangotri. For more than twenty years he did not
even come to the village, such was his vairagya. But
suddenly, desire arose in his mind to go and preach to the
world. Of course, his retreat must have done some good,
because no tapas goes without effect. Such a temptation
also came to the Buddha. Mara said to him: “You have
attained the highest! Go and preach to the world!” If one
yields to this, he returns before reaching the topmost level,
feeling a satisfaction that the world recognises him, and
spiritual pride takes over. It is difficult to truly transcend
this stage; and it is doubtful if there is anyone now who has
done it. It would be a rise to universal renown and
universal knowledge.
yathā purastād bhavitā pratīta auddālakir āruṇir
matprasṛṣṭaḥ,
sukhaṁ rātrīś śayitā vītamanyus tvāṁ dadṛśivān
mṛtyumukhāt pramuktam. (11)

Yama says: “Your first boon is granted, and you will be
recognised by your father who will be happy to receive you,
who has returned with knowledge. What is the second
boon?”
Nachiketas’s Second Wish: Understanding of the
Sacrifical Fire
svarge loke na bhayaṁ kiṁ ca nāsti na tatra tvaṁ na jarayā
bibheti.
ubhe tīrtvā aśanāyā pipāse śokātigo modate svarga-loke. (12)

16

Nachiketas asks: “Lord, I have heard that in heaven
there is supreme satisfaction, there is no death. People are
youthful, with no fear of old age. How do they gain
immortality? Teach me that secret!”
Gods in heaven experience only birth, youth and
growth; no old age and death. There are two heavens, the
lower and the higher. The lower one referred to in the
Puranas is indra-loka, and the higher one is brahma-loka.
Nachiketas may be referring to both of them. In the lower
heaven is intense joy. It is like our world; a counterpart to
our desires, but there is no heat, cold, hunger, thirst, old
age, disease and death, all of which are our sufferings here.
The individuals there are partaking of the glory of the
realm. But from that heaven, one has to come back. One
may go there on account of having done good deeds here,
but on exhaustion of their merits, he returns. The higher
heaven or brahma-loka is different in its nature: it is
identical with hiranyagarbha. And here, one crosses over
hunger and thirst.
When one becomes the Soul of the cosmos, or
hiranyagarbha, there is no return. It is enjoyment not only
after death, but even while living. This state is known as
jivanmukti, and described in various ways in our scriptures.
It is the state of vaishvanara, identified with vaishvanaraagni or nachiketas-agni, or universal fire. This vaishvanara
is ishvara, the Universal Man (vishva and nara:
vaishvanara) to be attained through a mysterious upasana
by imagining, in internal meditation, the external sacrifice.
The Aranyakas contain such types of meditation where the
actual sacrifice is contemplated in the mind, without
material objects. The nachiketas-agni is an example of this
17

type. This particular portion of the Upanishad is a faint
memory of the Aranyaka portion of the Taittiriya
Brahmana.
sa tvam agniṁ svargyam adhyeṣi mṛtyo, prabrῡhi taṁ
śraddadānāya mahyam
svarga-lokā amṛtatvam bhajanta, etad dvitīyena vṛṇe vareṇa.
(13)

“O Yama, you know the secret of the performance of
this mysterious universal fire- sacrifice, by which one can
attain heaven. Teach this to me, who has come with faith. I
am honest. I have heard that they become immortal, who
reach that abode. This I choose as my second boon.” From
the external sacrifice of Gautama, we turn to the internal
one of Nachiketas.
pra te bravīmi tad u me nibodha svargyam agniṁ naciketaḥ
prajānan
anantalokāptim atho pratiṣṭhāṁ viddhi, tvam etaṁ nihitaṁ
guhāyām. (14)

“Well, I shall tell you the secret,” says Yama. “I do know
it, and I know that you know that I know. This heavenly
fire, which is not physical, is the support of the
Viratpurusha, the universe; and it is in your heart, secretly.”
What is this universal fire? Not found in the kitchen,
not found in the house, but in the heart of everyone. Just as
the ocean is in every drop, the Universal is in you, and can
be invoked. The knowledge of this agni is equal to
becoming the support of this universe, attaining to all
worlds, nay, he himself is this creation. Wonderful is this
teaching! It is not easy to explain what this universal fire is.
The fifteenth mantra says it very enigmatically, and it is
difficult to understand.
18

lokādim agniṃ tam uvāca tasmai, yā iṣṭakā, yāvatīr vā, yathā
vā.
sa cāpi tat pratsvadat yathoktam; athāsya mṛtyuḥ punar
evāha tuṣṭaḥ. (15)

The Upanishad does not reveal what Yama told
Nachiketas, but uses a mystical language: agni is the origin
of everything, and creation emanates from it.
“This sacrifice can be done either internally or
externally, even as you can adore God by thinking of Him,
or by offering flowers to Him. The nature of the substance
with which to build this altar, the number of bricks and the
way of lighting the fire—these three are the difficult things
in the sacrifice. Whatever Yama spoke, Nachiketas repeated
it just as it had been told.”
tam abravīt prīyamāṇo mahātmā varaṁ tavehādya dadāmi
bhῡyaḥ.
tavaiva nāmnā bhavitāyam agniḥ, sṛṅkāṁ cemām anekarῡpāṁ gṛhāṇa. (16)

“Yama was very pleased with his competence and said:
‘My dear child, I give you here another boon: I ordain that
from now on this sacrifice will be called by your name
instead of vaishvanara-agni. Take also this multi-coloured
garland’ (symbolising prakriti).”
In mystical texts, the spiritual experience in this
condition is compared to a garland of different colours that
adorns the seeker, indicating manifold experiences and not
only a single one. Here, one is blessed with universal
knowledge of the past, present and future, and of memory
of previous births. Past and future become an eternal
present.
19

There are many stages of God-attainment, and three or
four major ones. One of them is the acquisition of
omniscience, or universal knowledge, or being
hiranyagarbha, the Soul of the universe. This meditation
which gives the practitioner supernatural knowledge—
because the world which is normally seen as an external
object enters into himself—is described elsewhere in this
Upanishad. A Guru has to teach personally how this is
done.
triṇāciketas tribhir etya sandhiṁ trikarma-kṛt tarati janmamṛtyῡ
brahmajajñaṁ devam īḍyam viditvā nicāyye’māṁ śāntim
atyantam eti. (17)

This is the crux of the teaching. The performance is
threefold; the means employed are threefold; the action is
threefold. It is only through the tradition of a Guru
explaining this enigmatic mantra that we know its meaning.
What is this threefold performance symbolised by the
threefold fast? It is self-control in the three realms. In
addition to physical fast, also fast mentally. And thirdly,
you should not even have a subconscious desire, not even
for renown or omniscience. This threefold internal
meditation is trinaciketas: piercing through mind, intellect
and soul. Another explanation says it means father, mother,
Guru—threefold gathering of knowledge. Still another
holds that by performing the three duties: tapas, dana and
yajna—the three austerities relating to oneself, world and
God—one transcends mind, intellect and individuality;
tapas meaning the restraint of one’s passions; dana the
giving out of oneself to the world, thereby killing the ego;
and yajna the sacrifice of one’s individuality. “By these, one
20

crosses over birth and death. Then the flame burns steadily
in the form of divine experience, born of Brahma or the
Universal. Knowing Him, resplendent and adorable, one
reaches peace ultimate.”
triṇāciketas trayam etad viditvā ya evaṁ vidvāṁś cinute
nāciketam,
sa mṛtyu-pāśān purataḥ praṇodya śokātigo modate svargaloke. (18)

“Nachiketas, I have told you the secret of internal
meditation, hereafter to be called nachiketas-agni.
Performing it, he who lights thrice this fire breaks the
bonds of birth and death (which are but raga and dvesha).
Breaking them, one becomes a jivanmukta in this very
birth. Freed from all sorrow, he reaches the highest heaven
of divine bliss.”
eṣa te’gnir naciketas svargyo yam avṛṇīthāḥ dvitīyena vareṇa.
etam agnim tavaiva pravakṣyanti janāsas; tṛtīyaṁ varaṁ
naciketo vṛṇīṣva. (19)

As a result of two days’ fasting, Nachiketas received the
blessing of two great boons. Now, Yama speaks to him
about the third one: “Nachiketas, your second boon has
also been granted; the fire sacrifice will be known by your
name. Choose now your third boon.”
Nachiketas’s Third Wish:
Knowledge Concerning the Final Death
yeyam prete vicikitsā manuṣye’stītyeke nāyam astīti caike;
etat vidyām anuśiṣṭas tvayāham, varāṇām eṣa varas tṛtīyaḥ.
(20)

The boy now surprises Yama by raising a most unusual
and unexpected point, a question that most people would

not even think about: “I ask of you not any material object,
but a knowledge which I wish to receive. What happens to
the soul when it reaches its final death—extinction of
personality. Some hold that nothing exists; that all is void.
Some say, something is. I shall regard your blessing me with
this knowledge as my third boon.” This is not the death
people normally undergo but the other one, when the soul
crosses all phenomena. Does it exist there, or does it get
extinguished?
This question was also put to the Buddha. He replied
that to say something exists or nothing exists is both wrong.
Maitreyi asked Yajnavalkya about this same theme, to
which he answered that after final death, there is no selfconsciousness.
devair atrāpi vicikitsitam purā, na hi suvijñeyam, aṇur eṣa
dharmaḥ.
anyaṁ varaṁ naciketo vṛṇīṣva, mā moparotsīr ati mā
sṛjainam. (21)

“Even the gods wonder about this, and have never come
to an understanding. Subtle is this truth, so subtle that no
answer would be adequate to it. So, Nachiketas, please ask
another question. Please release me from this obligation,”
said Lord Yama. But Nachiketas was not a person to give up
like that.
devair atrāpi vicikitsitaṁ kila, tvaṁ ca mṛtyo yan na
suvijñeyam āttha,
vaktā cāsya tvādṛg-anyo na labhyaḥ; nānyo varastulya etasya
kaścit. (22)

“You say that even the gods have doubt; that it is the
subtlest of truths—from this I can derive that you know it. I
am happy to be in the presence of the proper person! No
22

boon can be equal to this: I do not want an inferior one!”
With this statement, Yama is cornered.
śatāyuṣaḥ putra-pautrān vṛṇīṣva bahῡn paśῡn hasti-hiraṇyam

“I offer you big posterity, wealth, cattle, gold and
elephants in plenty; land and long life for yourself.”

“Any boon like this that you want, choose it, and wealth
and long life. Prosper, O Nachiketas, on this vast earth!”

“Whatever delights there may be, conceivable or
inconceivable, visible or invisible, ask for them without
restraint. Here are chariots, and noble maidens with
musical instruments, to serve you. People have never even
seen them; they cannot be won by men. Be happy with
these. But do not ask about this great death again, I pray!”
śvo-bhāvā martyasya yad antakaitat sarvendriyāṇām
jarayanti tejaḥ
api sarvaṁ jīvitam alpam eva tavaiva vāhās tava nṛtya-gīte.
(26)
23

Nachiketas says: “I understand your intention. But
ephemeral are all these pleasures! They wear out our senses;
we become feeble and old after their enjoyment. Even
longest life is nothing before eternity; and all the
happiness—because it has a beginning—shall have an end
also. These chariots, these damsels and enjoyments: take
them back; I do not want them!”
na vittena tarpaṇīyo manuśyaḥ, lapsyāmahe vittam adrākṣma
cet tvā.
jīviṣyāmo yāvad īśiṣyasi tvaṁ varastu me varaṇīyaḥ sa eva.
(27)

“No man can find eternal contentment with these, and
yet you want me to be satisfied with them.” This is what
Yayati declared after a hundred years of enjoyment: “Wants
have no limit; when one is satisfied, another one comes up,
and then a third one, and so on.” Thus, no wealth of the
world can keep anybody content. “And if I wanted this
wealth: if I know the secret about death from you, it shall
come as a corollary. So why should I only want the effect
without the cause, the former being transient and fleeting,
since we shall only exist as long as the world, for when it
gets dissolved, we too, shall have to go. I do not want all
these things.”
These are temptations in the path of sadhana, to which
Nachiketas gave a prompt and befitting reply. All objects
Yama offered come under the eshanas. There are three of
them: vitteshana, putreshana and lokeshana, also called
kanchana, kamini, and kirti; the desire for gold, the desire
for sex and the desire for fame; these three bind the soul
and prevent its further progress. Yama offered everything
except God, with the intention to trick Nachiketas; but his
24

ruse is met with equal strength of viveka and vairagya: the
power of renunciation backed up by understanding.
Whatever be its glamour, everything is transient. Even
glamour is relative to this world, and when the latter
changes, the former also changes, and we are in horror
instead of delight. Even if we are to really get these things,
they are not going to satisfy us. No one can truly be happy
with them, because wants rise ultimately from a lack felt
within, from an infinite Source which cannot be satisfied by
finite objects of this world. Like stones, that cannot fill the
vast depth of the ocean, the gifts being offered by Lord
Yama cannot fulfil the desires of a person. “O Lord, give
not these things to me. They are of no use. May I repeat: I
want only that which I asked for.”
ajīryatām amṛtānām upetya jīryan martyaḥ kvadhasthaḥ
prajānan
abhidhyāyan varṇaratipramodān, atidīrghe jīvite ko rameta.
(28)

“A mortal having come face to face with the Immortal
that you are, how could he ask for mortal things? By
properly scrutinising the nature of the various attractive
pleasurecentres of the world, who can ask for a long life? It
is full of pain, and a long life is only extending the misery.
No one who knows of That which perishes not, would want
what you are offering.”
When an object is presented before us, what is
presented is nothing but a shape, colour and contour. The
perception of an object is coupled with the longing for it, a
meaning it represents; and this meaning tells us whether we
should have it or not. It excites the desire to contact the
object, which results in delight. Happiness is of three kinds:
25

priya, moda and pramoda. Happiness by perception of a
desired object is priya. You get stimulated when you see a
desired object. When you possess it, the happiness
increases; this is moda. The happiness of enjoyment is still
more intense; it is called pramoda.
When one enjoys an object, one forgets himself, and it
is this self-forgetfulness that brings delight. The nearer an
object comes, the more pleasure it gives, and the more you
forget yourself. This happens when one experiences sensepleasures in deep sleep and in samadhi; in all three states,
self-consciousness is lost. But one does not know what
happens in sleep and in sensory experience. When you are
conscious of the object, you are not happy, and when you
lose self-consciousness in the possession and enjoyment of
it, you forget it and you are happy.
yasminn idam vicikitsanti mṛtyo yat sāmparāye mahati brῡhi
nas tat,
yo’yaṁ varo gῡḍhamanupraviṣṭo nānyaṁ tasmān naciketā
vṛṇīte. (29)

Clinching the whole matter, Nachiketas says: “I shall
not be satisfied with all the things you offer. I shall be happy
only with that thing about which even the gods have doubt.
What happens to the soul in the last stage? Nachiketas shall
not ask another question. Nachiketas wants nothing else
than this.”
The student has proved his worth. The glamour has not
tempted him, and he has stood the test successfully. This is
the transitional process which is necessary between the first
two boons and the experience of immortality. The
temptation of the Buddha is relevant here: everything was
offered to him. The difficulty is that one cannot know them
26

as temptations, because they come as realities and it
requires a superior intelligence to detect them and find out
from where they have come, and why they have come. The
condensed essence of all delights of all the worlds will come
before us as a bar against our progress. But when viveka
helps us, Truth shall reveal itself.
The world, through its laws, wants to prevent us from
straying away; like sheep in a herd should we keep doing.
Thus, the laws of the world to which we are tied take these
forms, and the more we try to go away from them, the more
they try to pull us towards them, and our attempts will be
useless if they are inadequate. These are inconceivable
ordeals. We cannot even imagine them now, and when we
are really placed in such a condition, we will weep, not
knowing where we are standing. Nachiketas is the
representative of human character passing through a crisis.
Yama is now pleased beyond measure and speaks no longer
words of temptation, but words of knowledge which soothe
Nachiketas’ burning aspirations.
SECTION 2 – THE EXISTENCE OF
THE SUPREME BEING
Just as the teaching of the Bhagavadgita commences in the
second chapter, after having described Arjuna’s confusion, the
profound instruction of this Upanishad begins now—after
Nachiketas having steadfastly passed the test.

The Two Ways: The Good and the Pleasant
anyac chreyo anyad utaiva preyaste ubhe nānārthe puruṣam
sinītaḥ:
tayoḥ śreya ādadānasya sādhu bhavati, hīyate’rthād ya u
preyo vṛṇīte. (1)
27

“There are two things in this world, and people pursue
either this or that. These two may be regarded as the path of
the pleasant, and the path of the good. Most people choose
the former, and not the good. The pleasant is pleasing, but
passing, and ends in pain. It is different from the good. But
while the good need not necessarily be pleasant, the
pleasant is not good.”
Both come to a person, and we are free to choose. But
we choose the tinsel because it glitters. An experience seems
to be pleasant because of the reaction of our nerves. A
condition that is brought about as a result of a reaction is
passing, and not being. Lack of discrimination is the reason
for choosing pleasure; confusion of mind causes a wrong
choice. When you grope in darkness, you fall into the pit,
but you know it only after the fall. Similarly, the senseworld is darkness, and sense-objects come to ruin you, but
the misguided mind cannot understand this. “Good comes
to a person who chooses the good. But he who chooses the
pleasant falls short of his aim.”
śreyaś ca preyaś ca manuṣyam etas tau samparītya vivinakti
dhīraḥ.
śreyo hi dhīro’bhipreyaso vṛṇīte, preyo mando yoga-kṣemād
vṛṇīte. (2)

“The dull-witted person chooses the pleasant: he wants
to pass the day somehow. He does not know where or how
the good is. The dhira or hero who is endowed with viveka,
the power of discrimination, chooses the shreyas or the
ultimate good.”
When the pleasant and good come to us, they come
together, in a mixed form, so that you cannot understand
them. The best example for this is the world itself: you can
28

use it as a passage to eternity, or for your pleasure. Yama
tested Nachiketas in the same way as this world tests us.
Temptations come every day, in every thing we see. We are
caught in them because we are unable to distinguish
between right and wrong. We do not know what will
happen tomorrow. But our ignorance is so dark that we
expect more pleasure, forgetting that death may come any
moment. Death is the best teacher; there is not a better one:
vairagya dawns by meditation on death. Suppose death
comes to you in five minutes. Suppose you know it. What
will you do? Will you act as you act now? You will act
differently. It is true that we may die any moment. Yet, we
do not think of it. Who prevents us from choosing the
good? It is lack of understanding, aviveka or ajnana, which
hides the defective side and shows only the pleasant aspects.
sa tvam priyān priyarῡpāṁś ca kāmān abhidhyāyan naciketo,
tyasrākṣīḥ;
naitāṁ sṛṅkāṁ vittamayīm avāpto yasyām majjanti bahavo
manuṣyāḥ. (3)

“Nachiketas, you have carefully examined all these
temptations, scrutinising the nature of their delight, and
you have rejected them; you have not taken my garland of
wealth in which people get lost.”
At the very commencement, Yama makes a distinction
between shreyas and preyas. It is not easy to do this in
practical life. Most people unwittingly go for the preyas.
This is illustrated by many stories. There once was a fakir
who, loudly crying, carried a dog to the king. When some
compassionate souls asked him for the reason of his
wailing, he said: “My friend who did so much service to me
is dying!” “Why?” asked the others. “Because of starvation,”
29

replied he. “But what do you have here in your bag?”
“Provisions.” “Why don’t you give them to the dog?” And
he answered: “Shedding tears is cheaper.”
Though it is a humorous tale, it reveals a truth.
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used a simile to illustrate the
same thing: When the husband of the village woman dies,
she will hit her head against the ground, but takes care to
see that the ornament in her nose does not break.
These are tales telling of the human heart. We only shed
empty tears, and call out God’s name half-heartedly. This is
because very few can part with their possessions. The
greatest obstacles in the spiritual path are the three eshanas.
Even the greatest of friends get separated if one of them
gives them trouble; so too attachment to wealth, sex or selfrespect causes trouble. And anyone who hugs any one of
them is a materialist, not merely one who believes in matter
and disbelieves in God. The practical materialist cannot live
without matter, but can live without God.
We think of life as a material event, and evaluate
everything in terms of physical relations. We fly into
tempers due to them, and pass sleepless nights due to them.
And due to them we get confused as to our duty. Positively,
they express themselves as attachment to sense-objects;
negatively, as inertia or sleep. Who takes to spiritual life
risks the danger of becoming a victim to stupor due to
sense-control, putting even the mind to sleep. Sadhakas
may get addicted to excessive sleep, or become gluttons,
due to sense-control, thus just being sensuous in another
way. While you deny satisfaction to one sense-organ, others
will become powerful, like a river when its natural course is
blocked may break open somewhere else, growing more
30

powerful than if it would follow its natural course. If the
senses are denied their usual satisfaction, they become
uncontrollable.
Seekers who have done sadhana for years may not
progress well. Often, a silent complaint is heard from
within that nothing has been achieved. This is so because,
while they restrain themselves physically, they indulge on
the psychic level. So, the most important thing in spiritual
practice is honesty to oneself, because the path is of one’s
own Self, or Atman, and external aid is of little value. When
we get tested by forces physical and celestial, we fail. Only a
real sadhaka knows the difficulties. They may look silly, like
a child’s cry for his toy, but to him the toy is of deep
importance. Seekers are placed in situations that tear their
minds apart; mind and senses go amuck. Pratyahara,sama
and dama in yoga are dams constructed on a river, not
allowing any leakage, and when the water level increases, it
is very hard to control.
Nachiketas, purposely tempted by Yama, is an example.
The Guru places disciples in such situations to train them,
to burnish them. They are blessed, because they are given
an opportunity to overcome the obstacle, and they are also
given strength. But those who practice self-control in
seclusion for years, without a proper guru, fail when the test
comes as a hard reality, because tests in the spiritual path
are not announced like school-examinations. In the latter,
date, subject, time and textbooks are pre-announced. But
here, there is no such thing: you may be tested any time, on
any subject, in any manner. So, one has always to be ready
and vigilant. The Upanishad says, later on, that one who is
31

not careful falls. It is very easy to fall, and it is even pleasant,
but it is very difficult to rise again.
“Nachiketas, I tested you and offered everything, and I
am glad that you were not tempted even by the universal
fire that bestows omniscience.”
Subtle difficulties present themselves only in the subtle
realms. In the physical realm, we have only physical
difficulties, the sthanidharmas. Each level has a law of its
own, and we cannot know the temptations and difficulties
of other realms. They are only theories now. And when
they come, they come not as temptations, but look like
necessities. When you know that they are temptations,
obstacles, you will not fall. They are temptations only so
long as you do not understand them. If you know your
enemy, you will be careful. So, they come with a mask, and
you are deceived.
dῡram ete viparīte visūcī, avidyā yā ca vidyeti jñātā:
vidyābhīpsinaṁ naciketasam manye, na tvā kāmā bahavo
lolupantaḥ. (4)

The shreyas and preyas mentioned can also be called
vidya and avidya: knowledge and ignorance. Desire is
ignorance because it arises on account of a
misunderstanding. Why does a moth fly into the fire? It
does so because of its ignorance. It does not understand the
structure of fire. Similarly, people go to sense-objects
because they do not know that they are harmful. It is said
that fire looks beautiful and probably cool to the eyes of the
moth. This is what happens to all in regard to objects of
desire. They jump into the fire, thinking that it is a soft bed.
Why does the mind through the senses move to objects?
Because due to avidya it sees something in them, like the
32

moth does in the fire. We see in the objects something
which is not really there. The coolness is not in the fire, and
yet it is seen by the moth. Children sometimes go and touch
a snake, not knowing what it is.
We desire objects, not knowing what they are made of.
They appear as one thing, but they are made of something
else. The objects are not made in the way the eyes and
senses see them. They are not solid; they are not beautiful;
they cannot give pleasure. Not only this: they can bind you
and hurl you into more and more misery and even cause
rebirth. In fact, rebirth is due to unfulfilled desires. But
everyone has to pass through every difficulty. Otherwise,
they are not known, as they cannot be avoided by mere
theoretical understanding. Solid objects are forces and not
physical bodies. They appear as solid because our body
appears to be solid, but neither of them is. All are forces
whirling in space, and they appear as solid due to our sense
of touch. When thissense is not functioning, you cannot
know solid objects, and so too with all the five senses; they
deceive you. This is avidya or ignorance: the inability to
appreciate and understand the true nature of things and yet
run to them. But vidya is different.
“Nachiketas, you are a student of shreyas because you
were not attracted by any of the objects I tempted you
with.”
avidyāyām antare vartamānāḥ, svayaṁ dhīrāḥ paṇḍitam
manyamānāḥ.
dandramyamāṇāḥ pariyanti mῡdhāḥ, andhenaiva nīyamānā
yathāndhāḥ. (5)

Yama says: “People who are sunk in ignorance,
considering themselves great heroes, well-learned,
33

understanding everything, are like blind men led by one
who is blind himself. They run hither and thither, finding
not what they seek.”
Foolish are such ones. We take advice from people who
do not understand. How can it be helpful? But this is the
world. People run here and there for happiness because of
their desires, but find it nowhere. They are misguided, and
it is unfortunate that there is no one who can see things as
they are. Everyone is on the same level of learning. Not only
this: the blind thinks that he sees, the ignorant thinks that
he is learned. Learning itself becomes a form of ignorance,
just as our happiness is itself ignorance because we think we
are happy when we come into contact with sense-objects.
Ignorance has two sides, positive and negative.
Negatively, you are not conscious of it at all. It is avarana, a
veil; what you experience in deep sleep. Positively, it is
called vikshepa. It projects itself outside, making you think
of what is not there. That is the dream state. Which one is
better? In dream we suffer more than in deep sleep, and it
may appear that sleep is better. Or you may prefer the false
happiness of dreams. The very same vikshepa also works in
the waking state.
There are three kinds of realities: pratibhasika,
vyavaharika and paramarthika. The world of waking
appears to have a practical value, a utility; but it is as much
a world of ignorance as the world of dream from the point
of view of paramarthika-satta. The objects are much more
real than the dream objects. Our present happiness and
sorrows seem to be more meaningful than dream happiness
or dream sorrows. The fact is that both are avidya or
ignorance—waking and dreaming. In sleep which is
34

avarana, as well as in dream or waking which are vikshepa,
ignorance prevails. On account of this, people think that
there is nothing wrong with the world and foolishly
imagine that they are learned. Can you regard a dream
pandit as a really learned man? Likewise, in the waking
state you are ignorant, and so is your teacher.
na sāmparāyaḥ pratibhāti bālam pramādyantaṁ vittamohena mῡḍham:
ayaṁ loko nāsti para iti mānī, punaḥ punar vaśam āpadyate
me. (6)

“The hereafter does not shine for the simple-minded,
who think this is the only world, there is no other; just as
the waking world does not exist to a dreaming person.
People get deluded because of wealth and greed for things,
and in this ignorance of youth, health, fame and position,
they proclaim: ‘This world is real, and there is nothing
beyond.’ These persons come to me,” says Yama. What he
means is that they undergo unending births and deaths.
Falling under the law of karma, they do not learn until they
are given a painful lesson by nature itself. There is not only
birth and death, but there is suffering. Those cannot escape
Yama’s clutches. They are proud even when they do not
know anything.
śravaṇāyāpi bahubhir yo na labhyaḥ, śṛṇvanto’pi bahavo yaṁ
na vidyuḥ
āścaryo vaktā kuśalo’sya labdhā, āścaryo jñātā
kuśalānuśiṣṭaḥ. (7)

“My dear child, this mysterious Being of all beings is
difficult to understand. It is difficult even to hear, and there
are people who cannot understand It even then. A wonder
is the explainer of It; wonderful is that person who can
35

understand It when taught by a competent one. Both are
wonders: the teacher and the taught.” Teachers of this
knowledge are rare indeed, and rare indeed are the
students.
The second section of the Upanishad is an analysis of
the nature of duty and desire: shreyas and preyas. Their
whispers are heard by us simultaneously—one trying to
overpower the other, sometimes creating a small tumult, so
that they cannot be distinguished. Daily life is one dilemma,
the conscience speaking of shreyas, and the lower self
murmuring that pleasure is desirable in preference to duty.
Why do people mostly listen to the latter voice? Because the
objects connected to pleasure are visible to the senses, while
the side of duty is not so visible. We believe in what we see,
but find it hard to believe in the invisible. The senses are
connected with objects of pleasure, but duty is something
which the senses cannot understand.
Often duty seems to be painful and imposed. The
reason is simple: we know pleasure will come by contact
with objects, but we do not know what will happen in the
other world. Limited to this world of senses, we cannot see
the other realms, so we do not concern ourselves with
them. And for all practical purposes, we take for granted
that they do not exist at all. The ignorant, proud of empty
learning, do not pay proper attention towards duty; they do
not believe in the ultimate good, in God and the other
worlds, but they believe in objects, even though they are
perishable, even though they may bring death, humiliation,
deprivation, because of their visibility, and this, because of
the indivisibility of the good and the other worlds.
36

Both duty and desire, the good and the pleasant, have
been examined by Nachiketas. This position is not one of
acquisition, but of understanding, of discrimination. He is
the example of a seeker who got over temptations by
comprehending, and not because they were curbed by law,
scriptures or the guru. When the disciple understands the
true situation, no ordinance by any of them is necessary.
When we are awake, we don’t have to be told not to drown
ourselves in a river. Nachiketas realised that objects are not
to be acquired for enjoyment, but to be understood and
studied. They are not for hugging. The world is not to be
possessed. No one can possess the world, because everyone
is a part of it; belongs to it in an integral way. So an
individual fails when he treats it as an object of enjoyment,
for the world and all its objects are an opportunity to train
ourselves in understanding.
The world is one of the ways in which God peeps
through space and time: “Shreyas or preyas—what do you
want?” He asks. Most people are like Duryodhana and want
adoration rather than the silent divinity that does not reveal
itself to the senses. The more we realise the
interconnectedness and harmony of being, the nearer are
we to God. The more the separation between man and
man, the greater the assumption of the individual, the more
are we away from Him. This is what Yama implies in the
conversation with Nachiketas: that the silent music of the
Spirit is drowned in the clamour of the senses.
Though God is speaking to us daily, we do not hear
Him because of the noise the senses set up. We see the
colour and the panorama of the world they present us, but
not Him. This is the meaning of ‘the other world is not
37

visible’, which includes God also, as well as the astral, causal
and the absolute. Realms beyond the physical are less and
less separated in their contents or units. While in the
physical world we see many persons, one thing having no
relation to another, the higher we go into the subtle realms,
the nearer do persons and things appear to come—just as in
a triangle with a wide base there is also an apex, and as the
two sides go higher towards it the distance between the two
sides becomes less and less until they meet.
In the Absolute, people come together; and when you
realise the intimacy of things, your love for them
diminishes, just as you do not love your body the way you
love sense- objects. There are what is called nether regions,
lower than this physical world, which are inhabited by
asuras, demons and the like—beings who are more
sensuous, wrathful and body-conscious. There are seven
worlds above and seven below ours, which means that there
can be states of consciousness worse than the human,
ignorance deeper than the human, and knowledge higher
than the human. The seven higher realms are of great
subtlety and intimacy, so that when we reach the highest,
one reflects in the other and one becomes the image of the
other. This is omniscience or cosmic consciousness:
everyone is everyone else.
We do not like each other because of our believing in
the reports of the senses, and thus we are said to live in
mrityu-loka: the world of desires and self-affirmation. The
higher world is not visible to the ignorant, and so we cling
to this world. If we were aware of all the higher ones, we
would no longer think: ‘O, I am so far from Truth’, but feel
like a dreamer who is aware of the waking world while in
38

dream. Like a sudden waking up from dream, there is
sometimes a sudden awakening into Reality. This is called
sadyo-mukti.
na nareṇāvareṇa proktā eṣa suvijñeyo bahudhā cintyamānaḥ:
ananya-prokte gatir atra nāsty aṇīyān hy atarkyam
aṇupramānāt. (8)

This knowledge cannot be had by personal effort alone.
You cannot get it by reading a book. The teacher of it must
be an expert—so subtle is this knowledge. “If an inferior
teacher teaches about Him, this knowledge will not enter
you, as He is thought of in many ways. But there remains
no doubt when He is taught by one who knows Him as
himself. Subtler than the atom is this truth. You may be
able to see an atom, but this cannot be seen.”
Knowledge is not words, but spirit spoken. The teacher
is like the honeybee who draws the honey from all books
and gives you the essence. The force behind the words
spoken by the Guru is important. It is his power that is
conveyed through his words. Not merely this; the proximity
to the teacher is itself a force. The words he speaks, his
thoughts and the good notion he has about the disciple are
important. Unless it is taught by a superior teacher, it
cannot be understood. Without him, there is no way.
naiṣā tarkeṇa matir āpaneyā, proktānyenaiva sujñānāya
preṣṭha:
yāṁ tvam āpas satyadhritir batāsi; tvādṛṅ no bhῡyān
naciketaḥ praṣṭā. (9)

“It is not only that you cannot attain this knowledge
without a teacher, but also that you cannot attain it by logic
and reasoning. But, my dear, taught by one who knows the
truth, it is well understood.”
39

Mental processes belong to the realm of phenomena,
but truth does not; and so there is no connection between
them. Even scriptures speak in a language, and words
cannot convey it. It cannot be communicated to another for
want of means, say the scriptures. It is insight—the
intuition of the Guru that reveals this knowledge. The
intuition of the Guru reveals itself as intuition in the
disciple. They are not two persons; they are only two
centres—one revealed and the other unrevealed. “If seekers
there be, if questioners there be, may we have seekers,
questioners like you, Nachiketas!”
The Requirement of Steadfast Renunciation
and Meditation
jānāmy aham śevadhir ity anityam, na hy adhruvaiḥ prāpyate
hi dhruvaṁ tat
tato mayā naciketaś cito’gnir anityair dravyaiḥ prāptavān
asmi nityam. (10)

There is a transition of instruction between the lower
and the higher, vaishvanara-agni and hiranyagarbha. “I
know that all the treasures of the world are perishable, and
that the perishable cannot be a means to the imperishable.
Yet, as a candidate of the celestial realm, I performed the
vaishvanara sacrifice. I have reached the everlasting by
impermanent means.”
This is a difficult mantra to understand, and various
commentators have different opinions about it. Some think
it is spoken by Yama; some others, by Nachiketas. There is
no ‘uvacha’ in the Upanishad like in the Bhagavadgita.
However, it cannot be Nachiketas saying it for at least one
reason. The speaker says, ‘I have performed the nachiketas40

agni’, so they must be Yama’s words. Because Nachiketas
has only heard about it but has not yet performed it.
Anandagiri’s comment, which has been accepted by
many, says that this is the teaching of Yama to Nachiketas,
revealing the former’s own personal condition. “Do you
know how I have become Yama, the Lord of Death? It is by
performing the vaishvanara-agni. I know it does not by
itself lead to the absolute Truth. It is anitya and through it
one cannot reach the nitya.” This means that nothing of
this world can lead you to the imperishable; even the higher
realms are, like this world, for the senses even though
objects come closer in these higher realms because of their
subtlety. The residents of brahma-loka do not have a
physical or even subtle body, but have only a causal one,
merely one step below the Absolute where it makes no
difference as to where things are; everything is everywhere.
But there is something higher than these levels: the subject
of the third boon, which Yama refuses to teach.
What is the wonder of this? The wonder is that nothing
is the means to it. The non-eternal cannot take you there;
and everything you have—body, mind, intellect etc.—are
non-eternal. “Then what is the means to it?” is the great
question which Yama refuses to answer. But Nachiketas
wants to know only that. “People say it is ‘something’. It
must be, because we are asked to do good, show affection to
others. A rule of righteousness is imposed upon us. So,
there must be something, but what is it? When one
approaches it, one loses himself. And when I am not there,
neither is the other. If the subject is not, the object is also
not. This is the mystery: that something seems to be there,
and yet it appears as not there.” Thus, Yama says that
41

nothing that is non-eternal can be a help in knowing the
eternal. Logic, your possessions, all that is conceivable by
your thoughts, is perishable and cannot help you. Hence, in
the realisation of God, nothing can come to your aid but
God Himself. The human element, everything sensual and
external must be cast aside, and only the divine element
relied upon. The question of Nachiketas is how to bring
about this transition from the human to the divine.
When the soul is released of its individuality, what
happens to it? No one has given an answer to this. When
asked by Maitreyi, Yajnavalkya says that the question itself
ceases to exist when the answer reveals itself. The
questioner and the answer vanish: ‘Where one speaks to
another,
sees
another,
understands
another,
communication is possible. But where there is no one to
speak, no one to see, and no one to understand, who is to
communicate to whom?’ Yama comes to a similar
conclusion by taking Nachiketas to the universal knowledge
of hiranyagarbha, to That Which Is, asti. We have to know
It as That Which Is. Even the state of universal knowledge
is comparatively transient, because in it everything is an
object of omniscience. The subject-object relationship
exists even there. But Reality is going beyond everything,
because there is not even that everything in the Absolute.
Though eternal means alone is the eternal realised; this is
the mystery. Because of the subtlety of this wisdom it is said
that a Guru is necessary as an embodiment of insight which
can be conveyed, but not spoken or written.
kāmasyāptiṁ jagataḥ pratiṣṭhāṁ krator ānantyaṁ abhayasya
pāram
42

stoma-mahad urugāyam pratiṣṭhāṁ dṛṣṭvā dhṛtyā dhīro
naciketo’tyasrākṣīḥ. (11)

This is a description of the state of mahat-tattva or
hiranyagarbha – the highest state that can be reached in all
creation, the satisfaction of all desires. Here, all your loves
and affections get fulfilled, like flowing rivers finding their
contentment in reaching the ocean. The movement of
desires to objects is a blind activity of the senses, continuing
until this stage is reached. All desires are due to a sense of
separation from the beloved object. The longing to unite
oneself with that from which one is separated is desire. The
urge to come together is desire. So, when you come into
union with an object, you seem to be in a state of fulfilment.
But, says the Upanishad, this is not really fulfilling wants,
because they rise again, like a creditor coming again and
again until his dues are cleared. If they had really been
fulfilled, why should desires rise again? They are not
satisfied with what you give, because in a so-called
enjoyment, you do not unite. The whole world cannot
make you happy because you never can come into union
with it, and because you fail in this, you take another birth.
Yet, you do not learn the lesson. Your understanding
cannot arise, precisely due to the desires. Satisfaction comes
only in the ocean of hiranyagarbha. Here, you reach a state
of perpetual balance. You do not stand opposed to the
object of desire, as you do now. You are able to move freely
into the very soul of it. There is no isolation of subjectobject, and hence there is perpetual happiness.
Hiranyagarbha, the universal mind or intelligence, is
also the support of all the worlds, the cause of all creation.
The virat is an external or physical expression of that
43

internal hiranyagarbha. Just as our mental condition
supports our body, hiranyagarbha supports all the worlds.
Here, all sacrifices, all good works, all charity, find their
rewards, because from indra-loka, swarga-loka and other
realms, you come back, but from brahma-loka there is no
return. Tearless is this region, because there are no desires.
Where there is no desire, there is no fear, because there is
no opposition or counterpart to one another. One flows,
merges into the other. All your praises reach
hiranyagarbha. You may praise anyone, it reaches Him. All
words that you utter are a description of His Being. He is
the only object of praise. When you call anyone, you call
Him. When you taunt anyone, you taunt Him, because He
is the One Ultimate Being. He is the grand Goal of
expression in action and speech. Can you imagine this
state? Your head will reel. Nachiketas rejected even this,
because it is a part of creation.
“Having seen this Supreme Being, O wise Nachiketas,
you have rejected even this!”
taṁ durdarśaṁ gῡḍham anupraviṣṭaṁ guhāhitaṁ
gahvareṣṭham purāṇam
adhyātma-yogādhigamena devam matvā dhīro harṣa-śokau
jahāti. (12)

What did he choose, then? Hiranyagarbha is the highest
satisfaction, but the seeking soul must abandon It and ask
for that which is hidden even behind It. What happens to a
person when he overcomes the sense of individuality, was
Nachiketas’ question, and Yama, satisfied, begins to answer.
That about which even the gods have doubt, about
which even the scriptures do not speak adequately, what is
That—That Being which cannot be perceived, either by the
44

eyes or any other sense-organ? He is the most hidden of all
hidden secrets, the mysterious divine Being. Where is He
hidden? In the jungles? In the caves? In the sky? In the
forest? What a mystery! People go to different places
seeking Him, but He is hidden in the bottom of the very
seeker himself. You carry Him wherever you go, yet you ask
for Him. He cannot be seen because He is what sees
through the eyes. He cannot be thought of, because He is
that which thinks through the mind. So deeply hidden is He
in your own heart that you cannot see Him. You yourself
stand as an object to Him. You are an empirical subject,
while He is the Absolute Subject or the paramarthika-satta.
Most ancient is this Being.
He was here before your coming into existence, before
creation came into existence. Before the creation of the
cosmos, even behind the sankalpa of the cosmic Creator He
was. And so, even the gods came into being after Him.
Temporary, transient things cannot be a means to the
realisation of this Truth. There is something fundamentally
wrong in our approach to it. You can liken it to a supreme
emperor whom one can approach by no means; yet he is
approachable. Even the ground upon which you tread to
see the king is his. Similarly, even the life that we possess
that we possess is His. It is difficult, thus, to understand
how to reach Him. Nothing can please Him because He has
everything. You cannot offer anything to Him because
everything belongs to Him, and you yourself are His
property. Then, what is the way? Yama does not want to
explain it, because it cannot be explained, as all questions
imply the connection of a means with an end, while He is
neither a means nor an end.
45

By the practice of adhyatma-yoga this God of gods is
known. This yoga is the way to God-realisation. In the
whole Kathopanishad, there is no explanation of what this
adhyatma-yoga is. We have to go to other Upanishads, like
the Brhadaranyaka— especially in the discourses of
Yajnavalkya to Janaka and Maitreyi—for a description of it.
“There is no conceivable consciousness after the
annihilation of individuality. Then you have nothing before
you, of what can you be conscious? And yet I say it is
consciousness; for while there is nothing to be conscious of,
still It Is consciousness, because everything has merged into
It. This is the Absolute.”
Adhyatma-yoga is a state of meditation where there is
no thinking. Where there are objects to think of, it is
hiranyagarbha, but where everything has merged into
consciousness, nothing remains to be explained.
“It is attainable by him through whom it is sought,” is
Sankara’s explanation to this mantra. The seeker and the
sought are the same. “One, having known that primal God
deeply hidden in the cave of the heart, abandons joy and
sorrow because they belong to the world of thought.”
etac chrutvā samparigṛhya martyaḥ pravṛhya dharmyam
aṇum etam āpya
sa modate modanīyaṁ hi labdhvā vivṛtaṁ sadma
naciketasam manye. (13)

Yama continues: “On hearing this and reaching the
Essence, the Source of joy, one rises to a status of ecstatic
consciousness. Nachiketas, for you this gate is open.”
It is difficult to say what happens to him who catches a
glimpse of it. The Atman is the support of all dharma, the
supreme law. Every law is but an expression of His nature.
46

This supreme righteousness is anu, the subtlest of all
existences, and once we have seen the Atman, we know all
laws. Saints are therefore the vehicles of righteousness.
They do not follow the Manu Smirti or any other law, but
the smritis follow them. If one listens to this supreme
dharma, one gets transported into spiritual ecstasy. One
becomes supremely joyous, because the object of joy has
been attained. If your son whom you thought dead came
back to you, how joyous you would be! You have lost your
own Self and you have found it now! That which you have
been seeking for years and years has come!
While the gates of heaven are closed to ordinary people,
they are open to such seekers as Nachiketas who have a
clarified understanding. Really speaking, the gates of
heaven are always open. What happens is that people lose
their eyesight when they go near them. This happens every
day to us, in deep sleep. We touch them, but we become
unconscious and blindly pass them by, and then say that
they are closed. Our own desires make us pass them by
when we try to approach these gates, by saying: ‘We are
unfulfilled! No going unless we are fulfilled!’ Like the
worldly wife of one who wants to take sannyas forcibly
drags him away, the desires drag us from that high state.
They give us a blow on our head when we are about to see
God face to face. No man of desires can see God.
When Sri Krishna was to visit Duryodhana’s palace,
Vidura told the people that they would not see Him. The
reason behind this is that the Lord cannot be seen by men
of desires.
anyatra dharmād anyatrādharmād anyatrāsmāt kṛtākṛtāt.
anyatra bhῡtāc ca bhavyāc ca yat tat paśyasi tad vada. (14)
47

“Glad am I, O Lord! Please, tell me more!” says
Nachiketas. Now that Yama has answered, Nachiketas will
not cease to question. After having been given a wonderful
description of the highest, he says: “Tell me what is other
than dharma and adharma, beyond what is done and not
done—That which Is.” That which is neither dharma nor
adharma, neither truth nor falsehood, neither goodness nor
otherwise, neither subject nor object—what is that? Where
dharma and adharma have their play, where subject and
object come together, is world-consciousness. What is That
which shoots up like a spark when the match is struck,
consuming that which is hidden in it? What is That which
is neither the done nor the not-done, midway between
doing and not-doing, like the karma yoga of the
Bhagavadgita? That which is not past or future—not
coming by your effort and also not otherwise.
That which Yama sees is not a content of creation,
because what is seen is hiranyagarbha which has already
been passed over. You must go beyond creation. It is not
contained in space, and so not in time. It is an eternal
Presence. It is said to be ‘here and now’, meaning that it is
infinite and eternal. The question of Nachiketas is itself a
hint of what he seeks from Yama. That which exists as the
non-interfering Principle in all, that which is the Seer of the
activity of the cosmos—that is the Being which he wants.
sarve vedā yat padam āmananti tapāṁsi sarvāṇi ca yad
vadanti,
yad icchanto brahmacaryaṁ caranti, tat te padaṁ
saṁgraheṇa bravīmi: aum ity etat. (15)

This mantra is echoed in the Bhagavadgita. Yama says:
“I shall tell you about the supreme Abode which you are
48

asking for, which the Vedas extol in all their mantras; for
which people do tapas, observe vratas, do charity. It is
Aum.”
For what sake do people observe brahmacharya? They
control their energies to pierce through the fortress of
ignorance, to melt the flint of avidya, kama and karma. No
passionate person can do this. No one who lacks
brahmacharya can behold this Being. People think that the
Vedas speak of many gods, but they speak of one God only.
They speak of the same God in different languages. The
Veda itself says, ekam sat vipra bahuda vadanti: The one
God is spoken of variegatedly in different expressions of
ecstasy by the sages to whom the mantras were revealed.
When the Kumaras went to Dakshinamurthy for
wisdom, the answer was silence. At least Yama says one
word. The Mandukya Upanishad describes what this Om is:
a vast reservoir of knowledge and power, the symbol of the
Absolute Existence, of Brahman—saguna and nirguna,
accessible and inaccessible. In the form of creation, it is
accessible; but formless, as the Absolute, it is inaccessible. It
is the visible and the invisible. It is in creation, and it stands
beyond it as well.
The chant of Om is in itself a great sadhana. It puts the
whole system into spiritual balance. “This is the supreme
mantra,” says Yama, “the supreme Brahman, akshara.”
Akshara means a letter, a word, a phrase. It also means
imperishable. So it is all this. If at all you can reach
Brahman by any means, it is by Om. It is the Supreme,
beyond which there is nothing.
etadd hy evākṣaram brahma, etadd hy evākṣaram param
etadd hy evākṣaram jñātvā, yo yad icchati tasya tat. (16)
49

etad ālambanaṁ śreṣṭham etad ālambanam param
etad ālambanaṁ jñātvā brahma-loke mahīyate. (17)

These two mantras describe the glory of pranava or
omkara, the symbol of the Supreme for the realisation of
which people observe all vows, perform austerities and
practice meditation. It is the imperishable, and it is both the
manifest and the unmanifest, by knowing which one gains
access to everything. When you chant or meditate on Om,
you have with you whatever you want. You become
possessed of all things by realising it. You can possess only
that which you have seen and over which you have control.
Here, knowledge and power merge into a single experience.
One who performs this upasana diffuses his personality
into Om. The worship of a sadhaka is to get into the soul of
his devata, and when the upasana is complete, the devata
enters the worshiper, and both become the same. Pranava
is not a symbol in the sense of the term. A word you write
on paper may represent a name or description. When you
write ‘tree’, you do not have the tree on the paper. You have
the symbol which makes you call a tree into consciousness.
But Om is not like that. It is a vibration that is produced in
our system, and it is the symbol of the symbol; a secondary
symbol of Brahman. It is a chant, and not a written word. It
is a force or power engulfing our personality when we chant
it. Om emanates from the centre of the body, which is the
navel. The original condition of pranava is not audible.
Coming from the subtle body, it becomes audible only
when finally uttered by the mouth. The initiation into it is
most important, because this chant and meditation is a
great art, and is difficult. Once one flows into the chant of
50

Om, one transcends all mantras. Om has no devata—it is
all things, and to enter into it is to enter into creation. It is
the supreme imperishable Brahman.
It is Brahman because it gives access to everything, and
having experienced it or known it in realisation, or having
become it, one becomes fit to possess anything anywhere.
The answer to your needs flows to you from all directions
when this Supreme becomes manifest in your
consciousness, and you become an instrument of its
manifestation in this world.
While all other supports will leave you, it will not leave
you. It is the best of, and support of, all supports—knowing
which you reach brahma-loka. In its manifest form, it
represents brahma-loka. And in its unmanifest form, it
represents the Absolute, expanding itself gloriously. This is
the description of the soul’s liberation by stages, kramamukti. This syllable Om is the Atman or Brahman about
which Nachiketas asked. What is that which transcends
everything, was his question. That is Om. Nothing else but
Om can become a vehicle for the expression of the Highest,
because it is general and not particularised. The content of
Om is the Imperishable.
The Eternal Indestructable Soul
na jāyate mriyate vā vipaścin nāyaṁ kutaścin na babhῡva
kaścit:
ajo nityaḥ śaśvato’yam purāṇo na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.
(18)

“This Supreme Knower, vipashchit, is not born, never
comes into being at any time, and so has no death.” This
Atman is the Knower—not a knower in the ordinary sense
51

of the term. He is Knowingness; the capacity to know. He
does not know things like the mind knows or sees. The
knower of the Atman does not exist. Who is to know the
knower? If he is known, he is not the Atman.
When the form changes, the essence does not change.
Such is the Atman. He has not come from somewhere; he
has no place; he occupies all this universal space. He has
neither a cause nor an effect, nor can he go anywhere nor
become anything. Creation does not apply to him. The
whole of it is a vehicle for him, and nothing happens to him
when it changes. “He is unborn, eternal, perpetual; the most
ancient. While the body is destroyed, he does not undergo
transformation. Most wonderful is he!”
hantā cen manyate hantuṁ hataś cen manyate hatam,
ubhau tau na vijānīto nāyaṁ hanti na hanyate. (19)

“If one imagines that He is destroyed when the body is
destroyed, or if one imagines that He destroys something,
both do not know. Neither the destroyer nor the destroyed
know the truth when they think that the Atman goes with
the body.” The body appears to move because of it being
contained in space, but the Atman is the presupposition of
even space, and thus cannot move. He who thinks that He
can be destroyed knows not the truth because he thinks He
is an object, whereas He is the supreme Subject. People look
at the Atman like they look at an object, but He is not that
either. He is subtler than the mind and intellect, and hence
cannot be seen.
aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān, ātmāsya jantor nihito
guhāyām:
tam akratuḥ paśyati vīta-śoko dhātu-prasādān mahimānam
ātmanaḥ. (20)
52

“Smaller than the smallest atom is the Atman. Most
expansive is He, greater than the great. Because He is the
innermost existence in every thing, He is seated in the
hearts of all beings.” Never is it possible to explain the
meaning of the term ‘Atman’, because when you start to
explain it, you make Him an object of the world. This
Atman, the Soul of all beings, is the Heart; not the physical
one that pumps blood, but the Centre of our personality;
the very Source of all that we are; the Essence of our being.
Shantoyamatma—this Atman is peace. He is the flooding of
feeling that rises in us when we lose consciousness of our
personality and yet are conscious. When we forget the
existence of everything outside ourselves, and ourselves too,
the Essence of this is the Atman. The ‘I’ has a soul behind it
which is He, speaking through the entire personality. Such
is this mysterious, magnificent, elusive Atman who is
hidden in all beings. How can we behold Him? “Freed from
all sorrows does one behold the Atman.”
Ceasing from willing of all kinds, you behold Him. Any
sankalpa prevents His manifestation. If you assert yourself,
either by feeling or willing or thinking, you block His ray.
To affirm anything is to have sankalpa, and such a one
cannot be a yogin. Think not, affirm not, will not—this is
the way! He who has no personality, who wants not
anything, becomes fit for His realisation. How does He
manifest? In whom and when? Dhatuh prasadat—what this
means is a matter of controversy. All commentators of the
Bhakti School, especially the Vaishvanas, say that it means
the grace of God. Dhatu is creator, and prasada is grace.
Your effort has to cease, because any effort is an obstacle to
His revelation. When effort ceases, God’s grace unveils that
53

Atman. “It is advaita vasana, or an inclination for
advaita—realisation by the grace of ishvara,” says
Dattatreya in the Guru Gita.
How God’s Grace arises in the jiva is a question difficult
to answer, and the difficulty has been accepted by everyone,
even by Sankara. Knowledge arises by the will of God. But
Sankara’s commentary differs from the one of the BhaktiSchool. He interprets ‘dhatuh prasadat’ in an advaitic
manner. “Through tranquillity of the substances which
constitute the personality is the Atman beheld.” Prasada is
tranquillity which tends to universality. When the whole
personality becomes tranquil, when there is a tendency to
universality, the entire person gets focused in
consciousness. This is Sankara’s explanation. We may
accept both. God is everything. He is the other as well as
your own Self. If He is the other, you need God’s grace. But
He is within also. God can send His grace from within, but
can also send it from without, and then it is that you behold
His glory. It is not described in books. It is beheld directly.
The Opposite Characteristics of the Supreme
āsīno dῡraṁ vrajati, śayāno yāti sarvataḥ:
kastam madāmadaṁ devam mad anyo jñātum arharti. (21)

“How can one conceive Him?” Nachiketas may think.
Yama answers, “Sitting, He moves to all distances. Lying
down in one place, He goes everywhere.” He moves not an
inch, and yet He is the fastest of all things, faster than even
light. Before our mind reaches brahma-loka, that Atman is
already there. Here is the Thing “whose centre is
everywhere, but whose circumference is nowhere”, as the
mystic saying goes. You cannot describe Him by the words
54

we know. Only by such enigmatic statements is anything
said about Him.
Who can know the Atman? “Except to the blessed ones,
like me, who has access to Him, He is not known, this God
of gods who enjoys and yet does not enjoy, who is the
subject as well as the object, who is within and without.”
That fortunate divine person who has the knowledge of
truth in its essentiality is a dharma-raja.
aśarīraṁ śarīreṣu, anavastheṣv avasthitam,
mahāntaṁ vibhum ātmānam matvā dhīro na śocati. (22)

Once having beheld the Atman who is bodilessly
present in all bodies, who is stable, and in every process of
transformation without undergoing any transformation,
the wise grieves not and rises into rapture.” Just as breaking
a pot does not break the space within it, the conditions that
affect the body do not affect the Atman. When the pot
moves, the space within does not move, nor is it destroyed.
The Atman is present in all bodies, unaffected and
unchanging. The bold, heroic and fortunate one who has
known Him is the highest being and has no sorrow. Stage
by stage we are taken from world- consciousness to that of
hiranyagarbha, and finally to consciousness of the
Absolute.
The Conditions of Knowing Him
nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyo na medhayā, na bahunā
śrutena:
yamevaiṣa vṛṇute tena labhyas tasyaiṣa ātmā vivṛṇute tanῡṁ
svām. (23)

This is a very famous, often quoted verse: “Not by
speech can He be known; not by the intellect, not even by
55

hearing.” Speech returns baffled. Who expresses speech?
The Atman! Who can express the Atman? Even rationality,
His partial expression through the buddhi which is a
modification of prakriti, cannot express Him. Frail is the
intellect when it tries to stretch itself beyond its limits. As a
person who cuts the branch on which he sits will fall down,
he who tries to know the Atman through the intellect will
break. All the faculties of the human mind break down
when they try to turn towards the Atman. “He is known
only by him whom He chooses.” If God chooses, you may
know; otherwise not. This is the interpretation of the Bhakti
School. It is God’s grace that He gives you darshan. By a
miracle taking place, you can see God; not by ordinary
effort.
But Sankara’s interpretation is unique: It is not that
someone chooses, because, for Sankara, that someone does
not exist to choose. His understanding of this part of the
mantra is: “He is beheld only by That which is the seeker
himself.” That which you behold is within yourself, is the
meaning. Who is the seeker? Is he outside the Atman? God
is the prompter even behind the seeker. Sadhana is not
possible without Him. Rather than from without, the choice
has to come from within. The seeker and the sought are
one. The sought or God is not outside the seeker, choosing
him arbitrarily; if it were so, we would have to attribute
partiality to Him. Reality is one, and on the basis of this
doctrine, Sankara opines that Self-knowledge is an
inexplicable wonder: it arises—that is all. It is not caused by
the jiva, because he has no freedom. But, if God is the
cause, what conditions does He impose? If you say it is the
jiva’s karmas, you limit His power; so even that is not a
56

satisfactory explanation. Hence, either you accept that
God’s ways are mysterious, ununderstandable, or
knowledge is a miracle, and when you say miracle, you
cannot say anything. By the passage of time, by the
fructification of good deeds, by the process of the universe,
by the grace of God—by a mysterious combination of all
these factors which the jiva cannot understand, God is
revealed. When He reveals Himself, the person (jiva) is no
more. God reveals Himself to Himself. It is not an end
reached by the effort of human personality.
The whole difficulty is expressed in a single statement:
the Atman is the subject, not the object. Thus, He cannot be
manipulated by an instrument. Speech, mind and intellect
are signified by the terms pravacanena medhaya. Speech is
indicative of all senses. So, not through them, not through
the mind, not through the intellect can the Atman be
realised, because these faculties have a tendency to move
outward. They catch the object, not the subject. The mind
never catches the mind. Both the mind and intellect work
on the dictate of the senses which are untrustworthy,
concluding that all reality is confined to phenomena. Any
description of the Atman is given by them, and they cannot
conceive of anything other than objects. This mystery of
atmasakshatkara is given in the second half of the verse.
The Atman chooses the Atman. God chooses God. It is
Self-efflorescence. To such a fortunate being who has so
withdrawn himself into himself that he is indistinguishable
from the Supreme Subject, to such a one is the Atman
revealed—not by process, but instantaneously. It is a
timeless flash of a sudden consciousness which is called
atmasakshatkara. It comes by the maturity of one’s
57

sadhana. The links of this process are indescribable. The
last occurrence is such that it cannot be regarded as an
effect of all the preceding ones, though it comes as a result
of these. It is beyond the causational process.
nāvirato duścaritān nāśānto nāsamāhitaḥ
nāśānta-mānaso vāpi prajñānenainam āpnuyāt. (24)

There is no chance of success in any walk of life without
moral purification: “Not he who has not ceased from bad
conduct; not he who has no tranquillity within; not he who
has no collectedness of thought can hope to achieve this
Atman.” A person should cease from every kind of evil in
thought, word and deed, and then achieve calmness of the
senses, and then of the mind and intellect.
The three words: navirata, nasharta, nashantamanasa,
represent three processes of self-withdrawal. In the lowest
stage, we behave like animals, committing harms of various
kinds; a gross attitude of the tendency to see ourselves
separate from each other. This apparent isolatedness of
individuals and things, which itself is due to wrong
thinking, is affirmed by evil conduct. While all is
interrelated, we see it as differentiated. This itself is bad
enough, and is called a metaphysical evil. But it is made
worse by violence for the acquirement or abandonment of
things. Then it becomes a moral evil in addition to the
metaphysical one. The wrong is not only committed, but
also affirmed by harmful conduct, and thus it is a moral
vice and against spirituality.
When you have somehow succeeded in extracting
yourself from this illusion, you have other difficulties,
subtler in nature. Even if you avoid violence of any kind,
you will have no tranquillity within. Calmness of mind is
58

different from moral goodness. You may be morally good,
but not tranquil in mind. Spirituality is both inner
goodness and mental calm. This shanti within becomes an
effective instrument in overcoming duscharita or evil
conduct. You have to be good even when you are alone, not
merely to others, socially.
Even this inactivity of the senses is not total harmony.
Spirituality is collectedness of consciousness within, onepointedness and equilibrium. This is the state known as
samahita—a total surrender of personality; not a
mathematical, but a spiritual total. This Atman, the
completeness of being, is attained only by inner composure;
not by being intellectual.
yasya brahma ca kṣatraṁ ca ubhe bhavata odanaḥ
mṛtyur yasyopasecanaṁ ka itthā veda yatra saḥ. (25)

Grand is this Atman, marvel is His being! This is a very
interesting and humorous mantra. Literally translated, it
means: “He is That to which the brahmin and kshatriya are
both food, and death itself is its condiment.”
But there is deeper meaning to it. The brahmana and
kshatriya represent knowledge and power, internality and
externality, spirit and matter, consciousness and object. The
words brahmin and kshatriya do not signify personalities,
but the spirit behind them. In the Atman there is a blending
of absolute knowledge and power. “Some philosophers hold
that there is no power in the Atman, because power means
action, and since He is universal, there can be no question
of it, because to us power is always particularised, an
exercise of authority. But His is shakti, the capacity; not
karma or doing something. The whole universe is a
standing example of His power. You know how much force
59

is in an atom; it can blow the world. Then what should be
the strength of the cosmos which is full of them? And what
should be the power of the Atman who is the controller of
their source?
Power is not authority, and knowledge is not
omniscience—they are more than that. In the Atman, the
existence of one is the existence of the other. Brahma,
Vishnu and Shiva are represented as One, and as Trinity in
the Puranas. So also knowledge, power and the
transcendence of individuality—symbolised as death being
the condiment—are represented in the Atman. The
affirmation of individuality is death. But death is not
possible in Him, because in His Being all that you conceive
of is transcended. To us, existence is regarded as a
qualification of something. We say: “I exist” or “you exist”,
but in reality, existence is the substance, and is prior to ‘I’
or ‘you’. The predicate, to make sense, is connected to the
subject. But general existence is prior to particular
existence, which latter is better called formation. In the case
of the Atman, existence is general and absolute. This is
paramarthika-satta. In it, individuality is ruled out, and so
death has no meaning there; death is dissolved in it. “Such
Atman—who can know where He really is?”
This concludes the description of the general nature of
the Atman, hinting that when He is misconstrued, He may
appear as jiva or individual, which is equated with death.
In the next section, we hear in greater detail of the
individual or jiva in his relation to the paramAtman.

60

SECTION 3 – SADHANA
How can the individual exceed himself, transcend his
personality; how can man become God? This section is
important for the seeker.
Section one was an introduction: Nachiketas’ position.
In the second, we studied the philosophy: the existence of
the Supreme Being. In the third, we are going to deal with
sadhana.
Two Selves: The Universal and Individual Soul
ṛtam pibantau sukṛtasya loke guhām praviṣṭau parame
parārdhe,
chāyā-tapau brahma-vido vadanti, pañcāgnayo ye ca triṇāciketāḥ. (1)

The language of this mantra is typically Vedic, and so is
the style; it does not convey an intelligible meaning on the
surface. The Upanishads borrow from the Vedas, especially
from the spirit of the samhita.
We have heard of these two selves in mystical texts. In
the Mundakopanishad, we also read about them: ‘Two
birds are in the selfsame tree’; something like that is said
there. But here, they are: “Two selves, lodged in the same
cave, the secret place, the chief seat of the Supreme,
enjoying the fruits of meritorious deeds—these two that are
hidden, are like light and shadow to the knowers of
Brahman who perform the panchagni sacrifice, and also to
the tenders of the Nachiketas fire.”
You have seen the damaru of Lord Shiva. It is like two
triangles, touching one another at their apexes, wide in
their base and narrow in their waist or central point, one
kept upside down. Philosophically and spiritually, this
61

symbol is a great mystery. Jiva and Shiva are both
mystically united, as it were, in this combination of the two
sections of the damaru. You can say it is like the original
and its reflection in an unruffled water surface.
The figure looks upward in the reflection. Man is the
opposite of God in every way. Whatever God is, man is the
opposite. In the process of creation, there is a topsy-turvy
action: God thinks, and the world is. But in our case, the
objects are, and we think of them. The highest evolute in
creation is mahat. Then comes ahankara; then the
tanmatras and then, at last, the five elements. But to us, the
five elements come first. And as the world affects our
thinking and perception, we are slaves of it, while God is its
Master. The jiva is enslaved by avidya, but ishvara controls
maya. The latter is universal, the former is particularised.
While there is omniscience in maya, there is sleep in
avidya. Ishvara is sarvajna, All-Knowing. The jiva is
alpajna, knowing little. Ishvara is Sarva Shaktiman; the jiva
is alpashaktiman. Ishvara is sarvantaryamin while the jiva
is akadesika. This is the Puranic symbology of the damaru.
It is also of great significance in tantric lore. Heaven and
earth, spirit and matter, are these inverted triangles, as also
the difference between the supreme Subjectivity and
objectivity.
Thus, the two contravening birds hidden in the cave of
the heart, ishvaratva and jivatva, are possible in the same
being. The former is markedly distinguished from the
latter, even as the original from the reflection. What is the
distinction? Though the outer form is the same, the
reflection is without reality. The things of the world are not
substantial, just like a motion picture, where many rapidly
62

moving pictures make a standing man on the cinema
screen. He stands there due to the inability of our senses
and mind to keep pace with the velocity of the pictures’
movements. We are unable to catch up with the
constituents of the objects, and hence we see the solid
world. The Buddha is a great exponent of this nonsubstantiality of things. “Transient is the world,” he said.
Rapid motion causes the object to look static. The world
is an illusion because it is different from what it appears to
be. It is a reflection and has no substantiality. It is this
contrast between the original and the reflection that is
brought out in this verse.
The jivatma and paramatma lodged in the same place
are different like light and shade, proclaim the knowers of
Brahman and those who know the five fires and the
Nachiketas sacrifice, thrice performed. The two are the
divine and human element in us. Our animal part is not
considered here. It is taken for granted that we have risen
above it. Human nature often gets contaminated by subhuman instincts. Our passions, whatever they be—
intellectual, mental, sensual—are not human, but
animalistic, and blur the human nature. The divine element
comes into play occasionally, in times of inspiration. In its
lowest form, it is conscience. In its higher one, it is spiritual;
and in the highest it is the Atman. But the senses speak
loudly, and so the voice of conscience gets drowned.
Therefore, says the Upanishad, it cannot be known except
by those who perform the panchagni fire: a purification of
the sun, the rain, earth, man and woman. These are the five
stages of manifestation, and thus the means of expression of
creation.
63

The Buddha also compares the world to fire, the senses
are fire, the eyes are fire, and so on. By fire he means desire.
The whole world is a burning pit of fire.
Mystically, all objects are only formations of the five
elements and can be reduced to them. When they assume
the manifold forms of objects, the senses get heated up and
run towards them. Even with the panchagni sacrifice, the
five senses are still kept alive by the fivefold object elements.
The method of overcoming this conflagration is another
fire: the Nachiketas sacrifice, the divine vaishvanara-agni.
When It consumes the stages of our own being—the
physical, astral and causal levels—when this sacrifice is
done thrice, we become a universal lustre or radiance, the
same radiance that was shown by Sri Krishna to Arjuna.
Thus, the universal fire is one of the two beings (divine),
and the sensory is the other (human). They are the spiritual
and the sensual, the universal and the individual, the divine
and the human.
Though we have worldly enjoyments, we are restless.
This unrest is due to the call of the divine within, the higher
Being working in us always, though the lower tries to cloud
our vision, on account of which we remain individuals. The
higher fire is a glorious light before which the lower one is
like shade.
The Nachiketas Sacrificial Fire as an Aid
yas setur ījānānām akṣaram brahma yat param,
abhayam titīrṣatām pāram nāciketaṁ śakemahi. (2)

“This universal fire of Nachiketas is like a bridge
between the higher and the lower. This vaishvanara yajna is
verily a jnana yajna of the soul, the way of the individual’s
64

entry into Brahman. Fearless it is and also the means for all
those who wish to cross samsara.”
Here alone our restlessness ceases. It is called the
junction between virat and Brahman. From multipleconsciousness, we have to go to Oneness. Whether we walk
or fly, we have to pass every place on the way, though in
sadyo-mukti the passing is so quick that you are not aware
of it, like the hundred petals passed through by a needle in
one moment, and yet each petal has been passed. It is a
gradual ascent of the soul from the lower to the higher.
Parable of the Individual Soul in a Chariot
ātmānaṁ rathinaṁ viddhi, śarīraṁ rathameva tu:
buddhiṁ tu sāradhiṁ viddhi, manaḥ pragraham eva ca. (3)

Who is capable of performing this sacrifice? It is like the
soul driving a chariot towards the supreme destination of
Brahman. While It is the goal, vaishvanara is the bridge, the
world is the location from where we have to start, and what
kind of effort we have to put forth will be said in the
following mantras.
We have here the symbology of a chariot, yoked to
horses that are controlled by a driver, and having wheels
and a road. Plato also describes this vehicle: Two horses
pull it, a good one and a bad one; one moving properly, the
other one is restless and impetuous. These two are the
higher and lower impulses working in us.
We meet the chariot symbol quite often in the mystical
literature of this world. There is a reference to it in the
Bhagavadgita, too. Sometimes, the whole creation is
regarded as a chariot.
65

In this mantra, “The soul within the chariot is the rider;
the body is the chariot. The charioteer is the intellect or
reason. The mind is like reigns with which the horses are
connected to the chariot.”
indriyāṇi hayān āhur viṣayāṁs teṣu gocarān,
ātmendriya-mano-yuktam bhoktety āhur manīṣiṇaḥ. (4)

“The senses are the horses, the objects are the roads
along which the chariot is driven; the self, associated with
the body, the senses and the mind—the wise say—is the
enjoyer.”
This gives us an idea how our senses are connected to
objects of the world. The purpose of the chariot’s
movement is to reach the destination for its rider. But the
chariot is only a help, and the driver must be intelligent and
know the course. The Atman, in combination with the
body, the indriyas and manas, is a karta, doer, and bhokta,
enjoyer. Minus the intellect, we are karta and bhokta.
The buddhi is carefully omitted when the enjoyer is
described, because in enjoyment, the intellect is not
necessary. The mind and senses work together in the lower
stage, the mind merely playing second fiddle to what they
say and not being independent. The independence belongs
to the intellect or charioteer. Where it is lacking, moha is
created and we go after things. When the light of the soul,
bereft of intelligence, works through the mind and senses,
there is samsara. But we have also the higher intellect which
should guide us throughout. The correlation of it and the
chariot is described in the next mantras.
There should not be any kind of discord between the
two. The reigns should not break; the chariot should not
crash. The Atman is essential, the body is essential; the
66

senses are essential as motive power; but only blended with
the intellect they make a beautiful combination.
yas tv avijñānavān bhavaty ayuktena manasā sadā,
tasyendriyāṇy avaśyāni duṣṭāśvā iva sāratheḥ. (5)

“One who has no understanding, whose mind is
unrestrained, cannot control the senses and will be like a
person driving the chariot with wicked horses.”
Suppose the horses of a chariot are not controlled, one
horse trying to take it to the ditch or retard the progress,
while the other one is good, there will be no harmony.
There is always a tension in us between the higher and
lower. And just as a person will not reach his destination if
a horse is not good, a seeker whose intellect is clouded
cannot control the senses and does not move along the
right path.
yas tu vijñānavān bhavati, yuktena manasā sadā,
tasyendriyāṇi vaśyāni sadaśvā iva sāratheḥ. (6)

“But the reverse is the case of that person whose horses
are good and well-trained, and when the charioteer is
capable of understanding.”
In this case the reigns are never let off and the
movement of the chariot is proper in its course.
Intelligent Control of the Soul's Chariot Necessary
yas tv avijñānavān bhavaty amanaskas sadā’śuciḥ
na sa tat padam āpnoti saṁsāraṁ cādhigacchati. (7)

“If the driver of the chariot is bereft of understanding,
his mind is ever impure, the goal is never reached and the
chariot is hurled down. A person without self-control
enters the womb of samsara.”
67

When the senses move among objects as their road,
they do not know which course to pursue. If a charioteer
without intelligence comes to a crossroad, he does not
know which way to choose. Or if the horses go amuck, we
can imagine the fate of the chariot and its rider. The objects
are many, though the elements which constitute them are
only five. There is a tremendous excitement of the senses
when they behold the colourful world of objects. We begin
to see through them rather than the intellect, and since they
are diversified, we are presented a diversified world of
which we do not know what to choose. Thus, without
intelligence, there is restless activity.
yas tu vijñānavān bhavati samanaskas sadā śuciḥ,
sa tu tat padam āpnoti yasmāt bhῡyo na jāyate. (8)

“He whose senses are controlled and whose intellect is
purified; he does not come back.”
Are the roads really many, or is it one, is the question.
The roads are many to the senses, but to the purified
intellect it is one. The one road is hiranyagarbha, or
vaishvanara, in whom everything gets melted and all roads
meet. The diversified activities of the senses can stop only
when the Unity behind them is beheld, which is not
possible without self-withdrawal through intelligence. The
five roads merge into a single one. If five horses tied to the
same chariot run in different directions, what will happen
to the chariot? On the other hand, if they all move in one
direction—what will be their power!
vijñānasārathir yastu manaḥ pragrahavān naraḥ,
so’dhvanaḥ param āpnoti tad viṣṇoḥ paramam padam. (9)

68

“A person who has intelligence as the charioteer, whose
mind acts as reigns, he reaches the final destination of the
path, which is the supreme state of God.”
The last quarter of mantra nine is borrowed from the
Rig Veda. It says that the state of Vishnu is beheld by the
wise ones as the state of all-pervading ether. The place of
Vishnu is not a location or palace. It is spread out like ether
or space, like the ocean. The river is everywhere when it
reaches the ocean and does not remain localised in one
place. Likewise is the soul when it reaches vishnupada. The
Universal Being is Vishnu. The moment a jiva reaches his
destination, he enters vishnupada. Therefore the body is to
be utilised as a vehicle of action in the movement of the
soul to God.
There is nothing wrong with our senses, mind, etc., but
they should be directed properly. Evil is that which is
misdirected. A thing is not evil in itself, but when it
performs another’s function it is evil, just as anything out of
place is dirt. So everything should be in its proper place and
yoked properly. The world is a training-ground in which
the objects and senses are occasions for mastering our
energies so that they get unified through the senses, mind
and intellect. We look weak because all our energies leak
out through the senses. If you conserve your health and
concentrate your effort in a single channel, it is called
dharana. This will make you powerful; this is yoga. By the
control of the senses, the mind and the intellect, the soul
becomes fit for God-realisation.
After this description, another aspect is being discussed.
How are you to subdue the senses? How is the charioteer to
control the horses? They are mad for objects! What steps
69

are we to take? This difficult effort on the part of the soul is
called indriya-samyama or manonigraha. It is summed up
in the two following slokas.
The Order of Progression to The Supreme
indriyebhyaḥ parā hy arthā, arthebhyaś ca param manaḥ,
manasaś ca parā buddhir buddher ātmā mahān paraḥ. (10)

“Beyond the senses are the objects, beyond them is the
mind, beyond the mind is the intellect, beyond the intellect
is the Cosmic Mind which is hiranyagarbha.”
mahataḥ param avyaktam, avyaktāt puruṣaḥ paraḥ
puruṣān na paraṁ kiñcit: sā kāṣṭhā sā parā gatiḥ. (11)

“Beyond hiranyagarbha, the great Self, is mulaprakriti,
the Unmanifest, beyond It is the purusha, the Spirit; and
beyond the purusha, there is nothing.”
What do we see? The world of objects. The senses see
objects and move towards them. They see only the forms
which are called objects and do not understand that there is
something behind them. So they are running towards them,
thinking that there is something in the object which they
themselves lack. Looked at in this way, objects are superior
to the senses. But we do not want objects; we want to enjoy
their colour, taste, touch etc. Thus, a distinction has to be
drawn between objects and their qualities or essence, or
substance. These subtle essences, hidden in the objects, are
superior to them. The senses want not the objects, but the
characteristics hidden in them. The objects are not really
the centre of desire. They are only a vehicle which holds the
counterpart to our interest. We therefore want to utilise
objects as agents for our satisfaction.
70

The most important of all characteristics in the world is
restlessness. Whatever be the state in which we are, we are
going from one change to another. This indicates that there
is something seriously wrong in this world. We are like a
person walking on one leg, or riding a cycle with one wheel.
It can stand as long as it moves, and when it does not move,
it falls. There is only ‘becoming’ everywhere, and there is no
‘being’. Our whole life is activity, not existence. This
intention to act, this process of movement throughout one’s
life, indicates that there is an urge of our being towards
something, like the flowing of a river to the ocean. The river
moves, and its movement ceases when it reaches the ocean.
Not only we change; everything in the world changes: the
world is transient; the world is restless; the world is in
motion—it is all the same thing said in different terms. An
imperfection, or lack, characterises the whole world of
creation. Its motion, the velocity of objects, is what gives
appearance or shape or existence to it. Things do not exist,
but pass. This state of affairs is the cause of our
unhappiness. We cannot find peace with ourselves because
we have not achieved our end. What that end is, is the
purport of mantras ten and eleven.
Beyond the drop is the stream; beyond the stream is the
rivulet; beyond the rivulet is the river; and beyond the river
is the ocean. There is nothing beyond the ocean. This is
what these mantras say. Beyond the senses is the essence of
the tanmatras; beyond them is the mind; beyond it is the
intellect; beyond it is the virat; beyond It is hiranyagarbha;
beyond It is ishvara or avyakta; beyond which is the
purusha, and beyond the purusha there is nothing. The
smaller tends towards the larger which is its source. The
71

effect moves towards its cause. That from which a thing has
come attracts it, like a mother attracts her children. Planets
cling to the sun because they are parts of it. All things in the
world tend towards the immediately greater. There is a
cause behind a cause until a causeless cause is reached,
which we are in search of and which we have not yet seen.
The causeless Cause is not part of the chain of cause
and effect; it is different. The ocean of the world is limited,
but this Ocean is not only outside the things that flow, but
also within. While the ocean is at one end of the river, this
Ocean is everywhere. God calls us at all places in the world,
not merely in the temples and churches. His presence is not
only at one end of the world, in heaven. He is everywhere.
He is the purusha. That is the final destination beyond
which there is nothing. When you reach the purusha,
something mysterious takes place. There is a tremendous
difference between one thing reaching another thing, and
the reaching of Him. No unusual occurrence can be noticed
until the purusha is reached; there is only an ascent till
then. But when you touch the last rung of the ladder, when
the river enters the ocean of being, something strange takes
place: it enters That which it was even before.
The end becomes the means. The causeless cause
becomes everything. This transformation is supernormal;
impossible to understand. It is not an achievement of the
future, like the achievements of the world. Motion is
possible until the purusha is touched. Then, the process
becomes processless. This transformation is final. It is a
spiritual transformation, and not a physical or mental one,
a change which the preceding effects cannot know. The
effect cannot know the cause until it reaches it, and when it
72

reaches its cause, it is no longer there. Thus, there is no
such thing as knowing God. You do not know God when
you are away from Him and until you reach Him, and when
you reach Him, you are not there.
The senses feel far away from physical objects, on
account of which they feel drawn towards them. The
panchagni acts as incentive for the senses to move. The five
elements as well as the five essences behind them act
reciprocally and produce a sense of mutual attraction. The
tanmatras pervade not only the objects, but are behind the
senses also. And something happens when they unite, like a
friend meeting a friend after years. It is not union of two
objects, but something more, like the mother’s embrace of
her child. More than a mere meeting of two objects, there is
a feeling which is of greater significance: a consciousness
swallowing up the consciousness of particulars, and the two
become one; not in the physical sense of the term; a union
not even psychological merely, but more fundamental.
The essence behind sense-perception is not properly
understood, and so we are caught up in moha; we are in a
helpless condition. This condition of helplessness is
samsara. It is a pitiable state of affairs when there is a
mutual reaction between subject and object caused by a
force of which no one knows. Is there no hope out of this
situation? The Upanishad says that there is. It lies in a
higher integration of our feeling, thinking and
understanding. We should not be limited to the objects and
senses, that is, we should not be reduced to the level of
objects. We are friendly to them because we have reduced
ourselves to their status.
73

The tanmatras are the deeper essence behind objects—
including our body, which is also an object. They are not
electric energy, but finer than the molecules, protons and
electrons of the scientists. While electric energy is wholly
inert, without intelligence to direct itself, the tanmatras are
midway between the cosmic prana and the world, being the
vital forces regulating the physical objects and thus superior
to and higher than these and the senses. There are three
gunas of prakriti; and the sattvic element of these
constitutes the tanmatras, the rajasic element constitutes
the prana, and the tamasic one the physical world. Hence,
beyond the physical world, there are the tanmatras; and
beyond them, there is the mind constituted of their subtle,
sattvic principles like: sabda, sparsa, rupa, rasa and gandha.
Still superior in function to the mind is the intellect.
While the mind functions indeterminately, there is decision
and clarified understanding in buddhi; it makes decisions in
all matters. The senses give distorted reports, the mind
collects them and the intellect passes judgment. Here, we
have reached the end of the human world. The highest
faculty in man is the intellect. So man is said to be a rational
being. But, says the Upanishad, there is something superior
to the intellect. He has to rise beyond himself by a process
of self-transcendence which is described in these two
mantras. What is beyond the intellect? We cannot know,
because knowing ceases there. The Upanishads are
intuitional declarations and go further than mere knowing.
Internal and transcending, but unknown to it, are the wider
cosmic powers.
When we exceed the intellect, we go beyond the
physical. The jiva goes to the virat when his intelligence
74

rises to an understanding of what is beyond it. There,
human consciousness reaches a state of existence feebly felt
in ecstatic moments. The Upanishad now goes to the
universal Reality in its lower manifestations. Virat is
superior to the jiva who is part of It, just as limbs are parts
of the body. Virat, hiranyagarbha and ishvara are the
threefold manifestations on the cosmic level—
corresponding to the threefold manifestations of the
individual: the waking, the dream and the deep sleep states.
While we are aware of the body in waking, of the
psychological condition in dream and the causal one in
deep sleep, there is a lot of difference in regard to the
character and function between these individual and
universal states; the virat is not just like waking, and so on.
Higher than the virat is the Cosmic Mind or Intellect or
Ego which makes up the hiranyagarbha in Vedantic
terminology, or Brahma, the Creator, in the Puranas.
What is beyond virat and hiranyagarbha? There is a
twofold answer to this: from the point of view of the
experiencing consciousness, and from the point of view of
the state itself. Seen from the latter, it is avyakta,
mulaprakriti or mahamaya; the precondition of everything.
But seen from the former, the experiencing consciousness,
which is ishvara, we may ask: ‘What is in deep sleep?’ The
answer to this question is the answer to His character. From
one point of view, there is nothing in deep sleep, and from
another, there is pure consciousness. Since no phenomena
take place, there is nothing; but yet there is awareness.
Likewise, the awareness of existence of prakriti is the
universal ishvara.
75

He is the cosmic Witness of all things, and there must
be something even beyond Him because, even here, is
duality. Transcending Him is the purusha. The purusha is
not a male, It is Being. That which is cosmically existent
always is the purusha. It is another name for the Absolute.
Beyond the mahat is avyakta; beyond avyakta is the
purusha. What is beyond the purusha? Beyond It, there is
nothing. Once you reach It, you have reached the end. This
is the limit of experience, and the goal of all life; not merely
of life, but also of non-life. There is no such thing as dead
matter. There is only difference in the degrees of life; and
everything tends to This.
This description of the gradation of evolution is given
in the context of self-control. Unless we take the help of the
higher power, this is not possible. We try to control the
senses by will-power, which is wedded to them. If it were
wholly independent of them, it would work, but because
reasoning is based on the report of the senses, self-control
demands the use of the superior power. The intention
behind the gradation stated in the mantras here is to show
that we control the senses by the mind, the mind by the
intellect, the intellect by the cosmic virat, the virat by the
Cosmic Mind , the Cosmic Mind by the Cosmic Intellect or
ishvara, and finally by the purusha.
Self-control reaches its paragati, or culmination, in
atmasakshatkara, or God- realisation. It is therefore not
merely a closing of the senses; it is the practical side of yoga.
The whole description is one of dhyana, or meditation. The
best way of self- control is to think of God-realisation. A
mere thought of Him is enough to exert and exercise a
control on the mind. When you are overpowered by a
76

thought of God, the senses cannot function. When you are
in a holy shrine, in the presence of holy men, in an intense
feeling of God, self-control automatically comes, without
effort. But yoga is conscious withdrawal. A deliberate
attempt is called upon by the jiva, and for this, a meditative
process is prescribed. All yoga is meditation, finally,
whatever be the technique adopted.
That the senses perceive the world, is the present fact,
but you are not seeing what is behind the object, says the
Upanishad. So let the senses begin to visualise what is
behind the forms, internal to the objects and our own
bodies. The tanmatras operate behind both; let the
consciousness be fixed on the tanmatras. Meditate on the
fact that the objects are not all. There is prana-shakti
behind them and our body, without which these cannot be
active; let the consciousness be fixed on this. It is not that
the prana-shakti is all, there is the Cosmic Mind behind it;
let the consciousness be fixed on That. Higher than this
Cosmic Mind is the Cosmic Intellect; let the consciousness
be fixed on This. Consciousness should extend itself
beyond: just as I am, others also are, and just as there is
consciousness within me, there is consciousness behind
others. There are not many consciousnesses: there is a
totality of consciousness behind everything. This
Consciousness is the base; let the consciousness be fixed on
it. There is, beyond all this, a potentiality for all creation,
ishvara-Consciousness; let the consciousness be fixed on It.
This is one kind of meditation.
What are objects? They are known by a consciousness;
it envelops them. Because the objects are known by
consciousness, it is also ultimately inherent in them.
77

Finally, there is only a flood of consciousness which fills all.
This is satchidananda. This ananda is sufficient to exert
control over our senses.
The Taittirya Upanishad given the gradation of
happiness. Human happiness in a higher degree than we
experience – the happiness of an emperor of the whole
world, youthful, capable of enjoying everything without
disease, without any limitations – is the lowest unit.
Higher than this is that of the gandharvas. Higher than
this is that of the pitris, higher than this is that of the devas;
higher than this is Indra’s; higher than Indra’s is
Brihaspati’s; higher than Brihaspati’s is Prajapati’s; higher
than Prajapati’s is Brahma’s. You can meditate on this, too.
There is such a reservoir of bliss. Why go to the tinsels of
objects? God is Supreme Existence, is one aspect of
meditation described in these mantras.
God is Supreme Knowledge, is another aspect of
meditation. God is Supreme Bliss, is another one. So you
can meditate on these three aspects: God as Supreme
Existence, Knowledge and Bliss. This is the internal
implication.
The Method of Yoga
eṣa sarveṣu bhῡteṣu gῡdho’tmā na prakāśate,
dṛśyate tvagryayā buddhyā sῡkṣmayā sῡkṣma-darśibhiḥ. (12)

“This Atman is not visible, though hidden in all beings.”
With all the efforts of the mind and senses, the Atman
does not reveal Himself to them because He is hidden in all
things and therefore does not manifest Himself. In the
earlier mantras we have been given to understand that there
is a gradation of density in the manifestation of the Atman
78

from senses to mind, mind to intellect, and intellect to the
universal denominator of all things. In all these the Atman
is hidden, in every stage of being, in every object visible and
conceivable. He is hidden in a peculiar way, not like a
treasure hidden in the earth which can be dug out and
taken. The secret lodgement of the Atman is incapable of
perception due to a mysterious difficulty of ours, and it is
such that we do not have time to think of it, we are so one
with it that we cannot see it. We are involved in it so deeply
that we are unable to detach ourselves from it and stand
apart from it as a witness of the world-process.
The Atman is hidden in the senses; He is hidden in the
mind; He is hidden in the intellect; and it is enough if we
speak of these, though the Atman is hidden in the beyond,
too. So we cannot open our eyes and see Him, and also we
cannot close our eyes and see Him, because while we open
our eyes, we see the objects and not the Atman, and when
the eyes are closed, we see the mental process, and not the
Atman. Thus, when we do the former, we are in the world
of objects, and when we do the latter, we are in the
psychological world. For the Atman, the psychological
world is as tangible as the physical. If the senses regard the
object as external to them—to the Atman, the mind is
external. Who is then to behold the Atman? He is hidden
behind even the subject who wants to behold. The solution
to this problem does not lie in anything known to us. We
ourselves are an object to the Atman, and so we cannot see
Him. Such is the mysterious difficulty of atmasakshatkara.
The word ‘Atman’ has been merged into the word
‘gudhah’—this is in Vedic style. The secretly hidden Atman
is not visible. No one can say he sees the Atman, because he
79

who sees is still outside Him. What is the process, then?
This Atman is beheld mysteriously by the saints and sages.
“He is known by the subtle, sharp intellect of those
subtle seers who are capable through their purified
intelligence.” The intelligence, or buddhi, is not logical
intellect, or the calculative one of the ordinary individual,
but verily the AtmanHimself. He is intelligence, rather than
the intellect; the flame hidden in the fire rather than the
fire. He is Self-illumination. The Atman as the subtlest
principle reveals Himself as the Supreme Subject; never as
an object. He has to be revealed within, and not imported
from outside. The subtlety of the perceiving faculty should
reach such an extent that even the subject should cease. In
this extreme subtlety of being, we become less and less
subjective and are also not objective, and thus become That
which Is, or ‘That-ness’. It is called ‘tathata’ in the Buddhist
language. It is not subjectivity, not objectivity, but
something more. It is not seeing the Atman, but you
become the Atman; you are He. As said in an earlier
mantra: it is the Atman beholding the Atman, not the
intellect, mind or senses.
A small effort will not bring the Atman. It requires the
total sacrifice of your personality, not merely of family,
home, etc. This is the treading: of the subtle inner path. The
following mantras can be regarded as explanatory notes of
mantras ten and eleven.
yacched vāṅ manasī prājñas tad yacchej jñāna-ātmani
jñānam ātmani mahati niyacchet, tad yacchec chāntavātmani. (13)

Vak is speech, representing all senses. The speech has to
be offered in the mind. ‘Manasi’ is Vedic style. “The
80

intelligent seeker, the person of knowledge, should offer up
the senses into the mind.” This process is called pratyahara
in Patanjali’s Yoga System. It is that condition in which the
senses stand together with the mind in such a way that they
are indistinguishable from it. They lose their lustre in the
radiance of the mind. The sun’s light falls on a vessel; the
former is different from the latter. Even so, when you see an
object, the sense-powers get so much attuned that they may
be said to be one with it. You become one with the object.
They are not conscious. They are given an internal light and
act as an instrument in communicating it. The mind is the
source which gives adequate power to the senses for them
to behold objects. The senses get attuned to their form.
They are not in physical contact. It is psychological energy
that pervades the object, called vritti-vyapti.
The mind takes the form of the object, and for the time
being you are psychologically identified with the object.
You become the object. This is an undesirable state of
affairs, because you have become what you are not. The
Atman has become the anatman through a vritti. This is
sensory perception and attachment. We become not merely
conscious of objects, but also attached to them in an
emotional manner. So the senses have to be withdrawn into
the mind. These senses are not the psychological organ. It is
a mental force which channelises itself through the senses
and covers the object. The mind, again, is inert, which is
revealed in deep sleep. Just as the mirror is not capable of
reflection without another light, so is the mind merely a
conglomeration of prakriti. Only the purusha is intelligent.
So neither the mind nor the senses are wholly
responsible for perception.
81

The enjoyer is a peculiar combination of the light of the
Atman the mind and the senses, as explained in verse four
of this section. The sunlight passes through a doorway, and
inside the room is a mirror on which the light falls. The
mirror receives and reflects the light, illumining the dark
corner of the room. Even so, the Atman does not directly
illumine the objects. The mind receives the Atman-light
and reflects It on them. The technique of pratyahara starts
with recognising the difference between the objects—the
light reflected and the original light. The sunlight is
different from the mirror light and the wall; there is only a
shine seen on the wall. The light has to be withdrawn from
the wall, which is to say that the senses have to be
withdrawn from the objects. This cannot be done unless the
mind is moved. But the mind cannot be taken away since it
is not an object like a mirror, and sense-withdrawal is
different from any kind of laboratory investigation. It is an
internal isolation to be done.
Truly speaking, meditation starts with pratyahara; no
asana or pranayama is necessary. The Upanishad goes
straight to the psychological stage, teaching that by an act of
concentration attended with intelligence, the objects are
being isolated from object-knowledge, just as the light
shining on the wall is different from it. Not to know this is
samsara. For the Atman to become anatman is samsara.
The affirmation, therefore, should be: “I am not the object.
I cannot be the object.” The mind which sees it is different
from it. The senses are the five rays of the mental light, like
a candle in a pot with five holes through which the rays jet
out. This radiance coming out through the five holes is
sensory perception, which is really mental perception. We
82

are different from the objects illumined by the mental rays,
but the rays are not different from the light, and neither are
the senses from the mind.
Now, the mind and the senses are incapable of
perceiving objects because they are inert, should be the
attitude of the intellect. Thus: “The mind should be offered
into the intellect like the senses into the mind.” The mind
does not cognise objects, as we can see in sleep. It is the
judgment of the intellect acting as an intermediary between
the Atman and the mind, which is responsible for
individual perception. The senses and the mind are wholly
dependent on the intellect, it being the nearest to Reality.
The intellect affirms itself, and everything depends upon it,
finally. In this meditation in which the senses and the mind
and intellect come together, one stage of the meditative
process is achieved. It should not be mistaken for the whole
of yoga, as is often done in the West. Peace of mind
brought about by this stage is not yoga. It is only coming
back to yourself, from the empirical point of view. This
success is not final and is not yoga-sakshatkara. Sensecontrol is not over here, according to the Kathopanishad,
though you may no longer have gross passions, and may be
a highly cultured person.
Now, we come to a bottleneck; we cannot go beyond
this stage. “He should restrain the intellect in the Great Self
and That in Tranquillity.” All are held up here, because the
passage becomes narrow and only one person can go
through. Not even your Guru can be taken. You have to go
alone. Strait is the way of the Spirit. Even your body is too
big and you will have to shed it. Every student of yoga fails
when he comes to this point, because he has a tendency to
83

look upon what he has left, and his heart goes back to all of
it, and this thought is enough to bring him back. This is the
state of a yoga bhrashta. It seems that no one is fit for yoga.
This leaving the body is not killing it, but transcendence. It
is a spiritual activity that we are concerned with here. To
leave the world and body is to be dissociated in
consciousness with them, but we cannot do this. Things
persist in the form of memories. This is especially true for
householders, for whom it is hard to become real yogins.
How hard it is will be told in the next mantras which are
the heart of the Upanishad. If you are fortunate enough to
understand them, you are blessed.
The difficulty is to turn from the particular to the
Universal, which man has not seen, or understood, nor can
hope to understand. While it is difficult enough to turn
from the objects to the senses, from the senses to the mind
and to the intellect, it is far more difficult to turn to the
Universal. But this is what is needed. Here it is that we
require initiation. Up to the stage of the intellect, you may
practice yoga without it, but after that it gets difficult
because you cannot find the next one explained in any
book, nor can you find a Guru who has attained it; only a
few get that far. How the individual buddhi can be attuned
to the Cosmic Intellect is the higher yoga of the Spirit. An
initiation from a proper Guru is essential; and no true
initiation is possible unless your passions are subdued. The
senses have to be controlled, and the mind merged in the
intellect. Otherwise, it is like touching dynamite. You
should not go with passion to the Guru for initiation.
You should have transcended even the intellect.
Pratyahara is over; the individual intellect has to be
84

reabsorbed into the Cosmic Intellect or mahat-tattva. A
further description is not needed here. We will know what
to do when we get to this point. However, the Upanishad
gives a hint: from mahat-tattva, which is hiranyagarbha,
you go to ishvara, the shant Atman. While the intellect is
the connection of consciousness with a particular point of
view, that which is higher is the association of
consciousness with all points of view. You have no point of
view when you get to that stage. Instead, the points of view
of all objects are yours. Instead of visualising one object,
you will visualise all objects. You will say: ‘All are mine’,
instead of saying ‘this is mine’. It is the shifting of the mind
from one thing, one body, one object, one point of view, to
all things, all bodies, all objects, all points of view. The
buddhi has to be transmuted in the realm of mahat-tattva.
Hence, yoga here is sometimes called other-worldliness.
It is other-worldly in the sense that it is a science which
takes the mind from the particular to the universal, and if
the universal can be regarded as other-worldly, so can yoga.
But the Universal is not other-worldly, because it is here
and everywhere.
Exhortation and Call to the Way of Liberation
from Death
uttiṣṭhata jāgrata prāpya varān nibodhata:
kṣurasya dhārā niśitā duratyayā; durgam pathas tat kavayo
vadanti. (14)

My dear children, do not think it is easy! Do not sleep
and try to get this Atman. “Stand up, be awake, be
conscious; obtain wisdom properly by being initiated from
a competent Guru—understand this. Sharp it is, and
85

cutting, as the edge of a razor, and hard to cross.” ‘Sharp’
and ‘cutting’ are the two epithets of the sword. The edge of
a sword is cutting, so sharp is it. Such is the sharpness of
this yoga – so subtle that you cannot even see it. The path
of the Spirit is invisible. You cannot open your eyes and see
it. It is like the track of the birds in the air, or the fish in
water: they are there but cannot be seen. This path of
supreme wisdom is subtle in the sense that it is a balance of
everything. The Spirit is balance. And no one in this world
can maintain a balance. We either fall this way or that. We
go to either extreme but never are in the middle. ‘Balance is
yoga—samatvam yoga uchyate.’
This is an exposition as well as guidance on the path of
inward sadhana. The great method of meditation has been
explained as the gradual self-withdrawal, not only in the
realm of world-perception, but also beyond. It may look
magnificent, but the Upanishad warns us of its difficulty. It
may oftentimes look impossible. Hence, we are cautioned
to be careful in every single day of practice. But this is
extremely hard to do because, as the verse describing karta
and bhokta states, our consciousness gets commingled with
the mind and senses in every one of their activities. We as
persons do not stand as Atman, as mind or as senses only,
but all these blend and act as a focus, in which not only
they, but we ourselves, become conscious of the world. We
do not say ‘the senses see, the eyes see, the mind sees’; we
say ‘I see the world’. This is so because the light of the
Atman moves through the senses to the objects, as
discussed earlier. Hence, the process of self- withdrawal is
not merely of the senses. They are not the only culprits, and
are not wholly responsible. Meditation of consciousness
86

demands its extrication firstly from objects, then from the
senses, and finally from the mind and intellect.
Consciousness passes through the intellect, mind and
then the senses. And in a secondary connection, we are not
only attached to our body, but through it to many objects
outside, and to those they are connected to. This is
samsara-chakra, due to the original sin of consciousness
getting identified with buddhi. So is the psychological
creation of the universe, what is called jiva-srishti, the world
of bondage, distinguished from ishvara-srishti. The yoga of
the Upanishad is not any attempt at interfering with
ishvara-srishti, but an honest attempt to withdraw from our
own creation which has made a mess and not added a cubit
to God’s doing. We have created many kinds of
entanglements, consciously and unconsciously, all which
add to our difficulties. Our objects may vary from day to
day, but the way of perception is the same throughout our
life. Yoga is a system of disentanglement of consciousness
from its attachments. Hence, a seeker should be a very good
analyst and psychologist.
We have a false notion that the mind is inside our body,
not knowing it is elsewhere. It is not always limited to the
operation within. It has relations to circumstances, events
and objects exterior to its own body, and hence we do not
concentrate or meditate well. It may be working in a far-off
land, while a part of it is in meditation. It works
subconsciously also, without coming within the purview of
the conscious mind. The mystery of the mind is that it can
work doubly—the subconscious in object-thought, and the
conscious in God-thought. The working in the
87

subconscious level is such that even the conscious level may
not be aware of it. This makes our meditation unsuccessful.
The mind has subterranean realms. While the intellect
may be connected to the conscious level, the feelings will be
in the subconscious level, without connection to reason. So,
yoga is a failure, and there is no joy in it. This knowledge is
very essential in pratyahara. The process is not an ordinary
psychological action. It is to be undergone with a
simultaneous awareness of the internal psyche and the
outer intellectual consciousness. Intellect alone cannot
succeed in meditation. We have to attempt it with our total
personality. It, therefore, is not the work of one of our
faculties, but of our whole self as a unit of spiritual
consciousness. The Atman will be revealing Himself in
Himself only when the whole personality is withdrawn in
all its aspects. We often believe that we are happy, not
knowing the subconscious working of the mind. Man
falsely thinks that he is all right.
The yoga psychology is far deeper than the usual
perceptual psychology of the West, because the student is a
psychologist of himself, and not of things and persons of
the world. The turnings of the mind to observe itself, is the
unique step taken in yoga. You begin to study yourself
instead of others. This is the difference. Because you are
both the student and the teacher here, the Upanishad
advises you to approach men of wisdom who have insight
into the truth, to obtain knowledge from them and be
cautious and vigilant, because this invisible track of the bird
of consciousness is subtle and cutting, like the edge of a
razor. It is so even to the intellect—let alone the mind and
senses.
88

The path of the spirit is balance, harmony; not a beaten
path on which you can walk blindfolded. It is a subtle path
which you alone can tread. And every individual has a path
of his own. Though, broadly speaking, yoga may be one,
subtly, there are as many paths as there are individuals,
with difficulties different from person to person. Hence the
need for a Guru who can solve your personal problems
which you cannot probe into alone. Thus it is said: prapya
varan nibodhata—know It by approaching the Great Ones.
Impregnable is this fort, inaccessible is this path; hard
to tread because of the subtlety of the edge. The advancing
sadhaka faces many difficulties. Insignificant questions,
silly things, will appear large and important to hinder your
advance. The subtle body will begin to operate more and
more. Now we are on the physical level only. But when we
become more subtle in thought, more self-controlled, more
weaned from objects, the subtle body begins to work in an
intense manner. Then we face disturbances of a peculiar
nature. We do not know the troubles of the subtle body as
long as consciousness is lodged in the physical one, but
when we advance, the subtle body vibrates not only when
we act physically, but also when we think and feel. Later, we
begin to see it as we see the outer body and its activities
now. We become so sensitive that we cannot bear any
disorder.
As long as the mind is living in the gross body, it is
mostly on that level connected to others. But when it
withdraws itself more, it receives subtle vibrations of other
subtle bodies, and it can feel and recognise circumstances
on a level which is not only conscious, but far deeper. In
this state, it receives vibrations from the denizens of other
89

worlds and laws operating in the different realms of being,
the sthani-dharmas. In the earlier stages, it may become
receptive to lower spirits; in the higher, to divine ones. You
may be taken aback when these hindrances come, just as
when, in amritamanthana, poison came, the devas
withdrew. In the sadhaka, the devas and asuras also work
together within to get nectar, and in this contest between
the higher forces and the lower ones for a common
objective—happiness—poison alone comes first from the
internal practice of churning. Because like the asuras, the
senses too want nectar, and so there is often a fall in the
lower levels of the practice of yoga, when the instincts get
stimulated and become passions.
Many students have fallen on account of not caring for
this instruction: prapya varan nibodhata. The instincts get
roused when we rise to the level of the swadhisthana
chakra, according to Kundalini Yoga, and they become
more active, just as after the churning, when nectar came,
there was war between the gods and asuras. This war is
mostly unknown to the seeker who has not been properly
initiated, because the instruction given by the Guru is not
merely into meditation, but of the difficulties on the way.
He will tell you that at such and such a place there is a lion,
then an elephant, then a pit, and so on, and this is known
only to the preceptor who has already trodden the path.
Sometimes we know what is in front of us by God’s grace.
Cutting, sharp and also invisible to perception; this is
the meaning of the words: ksurasya dhara and kavayo
vadanti.
aśabdam asparśam arῡpam avyayam tathā arasaṁ nityam
agandhavac ca yat
90

anādy anantam mahataḥ paraṁ dhruvaṁ nicāyya tam mṛtyumukhāt pramucyate. (15)

My dear child, you cannot see anything there, because
the Self is not an object of the senses. You cannot use the
light of a torch and look.
“It is soundless, touchless, undecaying; without taste. It
is formless; the presupposition of all change. Without
beginning, without end, It is not anything that can be
equated with the processes of time.”
All these are external to the Imperishable, and while the
senses can grasp objects, It is imperceptible. Objects have a
limitation of their own: a body—a location, and so you can
observe them. But this Reality, which is beginningless, is
raised above all empirical concepts. “It is ranging beyond
the intellect, not merely the individual, but also the cosmic.
Only after beholding the glory of this Infinite, one can be
freed from the mouth of death.” We are in mrityu-loka, the
world of death, where anything may go at any time. The
next moment is not known. Can there be a more
unfortunate thing than this! The soul may pass away any
time and you do not know where it goes. Such is the
uncertainty of this world with which we get involved, and it
is most curious that our minds get attached to things which
are tantalising, and that we go to the very same objects
which have deceived others. Knowingly we enter the jaws of
death in the form of this world. This mrityu, which is
widespread, is everywhere—not only in one place. A person
is born with his death.
The event of death is for all common perception a
future one, but the cause or potential is born with us. It is
only a gradual unfoldment towards the manifestation at a
91

particular time. As all the details of a tree are potentially
present in the seed, so are the sets of circumstances born
with us. In such a world of death are we. And to be free
from it, we have to realise the deathless Reality which is
described as the transcendence of the senses, mind and
intellect, and identification with our own Self.
The Immortal Value of this Teaching
nāciketam upākhyānam mṛtyu-proktaṁ sanātanam
uktvā śrutvā ca medhāvī brahma-loka mahīyate. (16)

The first half of the Upanishad is over. Many think that,
because it ends with a eulogy, the parts that follow now,
were added later. “This story of Nachiketas, this knowledge
of the Universal Fire of the Atman has been told to you in
all detail. If a person speaks or receives this wisdom in
honesty, he will reign supreme in the realm of the Creator,
Brahma.”
ya imam paramaṁ guhyaṁ śrāvayed brahma-saṁsadi
prayataḥ śrāddha-kāle vā tad ānantyāya kalpate,
tadānantyāya kalpate. (17)

“This Upanishad, the secret of secrets, contains the
most hidden knowledge, unavailable to people on this
earth. Whoso shall cause its recital in an assembly of wise
mentors at the ceremony called shraddha, or any other
form of worship, thus purifying all rituals and giving
meaning to them, becomes fit for Immortality and becomes
infinite in his knowledge.”

CHAPTER 2
SECTION 1 – THE INTRICACIES OF THE INNER
WAY OF THE SPIRIT
The nature of the path and the way of treading it have
been described up to the conclusion of the first chapter.
This section one of chapter two describes in more detail the
intricacies of the inner way of the Spirit and proclaims that
until the Supreme Reality is reached, man is not going to
have any peace. All efforts in whatever direction are a
failure, and all wealth and fame in all the worlds will pale
away if this Supreme Being is not realised. Everything shall
flee and perish without giving the least comfort if you try to
acquire, possess or enjoy it without a knowledge of this
Reality. The worth of all things lies in It alone.
The Self is Not to be Sought Through the Senses
parāñci khāni vyatṛṇat svayambhῡs tasmāt parāṅ paśyati
nāntarātman:
kaś cid dhīraḥ pratyag-ātmānam aikṣad āvṛtta-cakṣur amṛtatvam icchan. (1)

A philosophical and psychological truth is stated in this
verse, summing up human potential as well as the nature of
divine Truth. “The original Creator inflicted the senses to
go outwardly, so everyone looks externally. Desiring
immortality, not satisfied in this world, some wise man
turns within, self-controlled and heroic.” We do not behold
the Atman because of the original difficulty that seems to
be sympathetically working everywhere; a tendency being
set at work at the beginning of creation: to gaze outward.
All creation is doing so. God looks at Himself in space. The
93

will of ishvara is this original gazing or sankalpa: the
creative affirmation, a fundamental urge, though
consciously initiated in the beginning; a deliberate and
wilful tendency to look at Himself, to be conscious of
Himself, to enjoy Himself and to do this in the form of the
vast panorama of creation. This brahma-sankalpa to create
is so powerful that it is felt in every part of the universe
which is His body, just as the effect of our thinking is felt in
every pore of us.
That supreme idea takes a concrete form through every
part, every being. Everything is made to think in
accordance with that original Ideation, though distorted.
The child may imitate its father in a wrong manner.
He gazed at nothing but Himself, a sankalpa raving
Itself for an object. While this is His original act, and while
we try to imitate it, our error seems to be the ‘otherideation’ in us, as against self-ideation in God. The senses
of the human being, of all beings, seem to be inflicted with
the punishment of looking and projecting outward. The
original sankalpa of ishvara is a conscious movement of
thought, while we think without having any control over it.
We drift with creation, while in ishvara, creation drifts with
His will. The jivas are isolated centres of thought, thinking
of not only themselves, but of others in the form of objects.
In God-thought, others are not objects but subjects. We
cannot understand what His thought is because we have
never seen Him. In us, thoughts work in a mysterious way,
independently catching hold of the impulse to create and
thus making us totally unaware that there is a
consciousness at all; so much so that there is only worldconsciousness and no Self-consciousness, to the extent that
94

even the Atman is denied. The Atman denies Himself: ‘I do
not exist.’ You as a centre of consciousness have identified
yourself with the object, including your own body, so much
that you see only them and are not aware of Selfconsciousness. This is the deterioration of the Original
Will, the mystery of God’s descent into jiva-consciousness.
This is maya. So we are world-conscious, body-conscious,
worried because we have lost our ‘be-ness’ in objects; we
exist as them. There is only a heap of them; the world.
But there are rare souls who have got a glimpse of what
is behind it. How they have come upon this Atman in the
midst of the darkness of objects, and seen light which is not
otherwise seen, is a miracle. How God became this world is
a mystery, and how knowledge arises in the jiva is a
mystery too. Dhiras, strong desireless minds who have selfcontrol, are the ones who have turned their gaze inward
and seen their Atman, and the Upanishads are their
revelations.
Consciousness drifts away in space and time; this is
creation. The scriptures tell us that there have been stages
of descent of consciousness. Just as a stone thrown into the
middle of the still waters of a lake creates waves deep in the
centre, and becomes weak in the periphery, the Original
Will of ishvara becomes weaker and weaker as it goes
through the human beings, the animal and vegetable
kingdoms and becomes finally arrested of all its outgoing
tendencies when it reaches inanimate matter. We, as waves
produced by the momentum of ishvara-sankalpa, are in
one of the conditions of descent. Because of this, we are
compelled to go outward, not inward. If this drifting is
allowed to go uncontrolled, we go to realms lower than
95

human. But if it is checked and allowed to know its
consciousness, it may try to recede rather than proceed, and
become the ripple beholding its bottom, which is the
substance of all waves.
parācaḥ kāmān anuyanti bālās te mṛtyor yanti vitatasya
pāśam,
atha dhīrā amṛtatvaṁ viditvā dhruvam adhruveṣv iha na
prārthayante. (2)

“Children, therefore, who have no knowledge of what is
happening, go after objects, and thus to destruction. This
mrityu that is spread everywhere, into it they fall by falling
into the net of objects, because when you get lost in any
sense-object, you are sure to perish.” The consciousness
that gets attached to objects is death. When the object dies,
consciousness, too, seems to die because of its identification
with the former, though it never dies. All affections are of
this nature. If the object with which we are identified fails,
as everything has to fail, consciousness also fails and gets
extinguished, and that is called death.
The struggling of consciousness to recognise itself in
that object which has gone away from its clutches is the
state of preta-loka. Literally, preta is ‘that which is dead’.
When consciousness, due to attachment, tries to catch hold
of what is lost, what is in a different condition, it is in preta.
The body is ourself, and when we have to go, when the
body is destroyed, consciousness seems to go with it. It feels
it is the body—and then it is the body. Pain of death is
experienced by consciousness when its immediate object,
the body, perishes, and also when other objects go. When
you regard yourself as ‘I’, you refer to the body, and as time
sweeps all away, it cannot exist forever. This is the law of
96

individuality: no part which is separated from the whole
can remain so isolated always. It goes back to the whole.
Thus, Yama is operating everywhere as time.
Death is a blessing, an eye-opener. Otherwise, we would
remain ever bound to this body because we are so much
attached to it. As long as this attachment is powerful, we
take another body, though Yama snatches the present one.
And so we are born and die, and we undergo samsara
because we regard objects as ourselves, and our body as the
most immediate one. Immature ones who have such
attachment to tantalising objects naturally fall into the net
of death. Yama is the form of the objects, and he is
everywhere, as God is everywhere. From one point of view,
it is ishvara, and from another point of view it is kala or
Yama.
God destroys you if you don’t want Him; He saves you
if you want Him. When you turn away from Him, He
destroys you as Rudra, and when you turn to Him, He
receives you as Vishnu, calm and peaceful. When you go
beyond the limitation of freedom given to you, you are
punished—whether by the government, health, or God. If
you overeat one day, or a few days, the stomach will tolerate
it. But if you persist in this practice, you will fall sick. So is
the case with God’s laws. Duryodhana was given a long
rope, but finally punished when the limit was reached. Life
is such an integrated completeness that you cannot
bifurcate it as spiritual and material. It is one. What is
called material life is the turning away of consciousness and
losing itself in objects. When there is Self-consciousness
and you feel a dissatisfaction with the things on earth, then
you are getting awakened to super-physical consciousness.
97

When you feel something higher, you become spiritual.
Therefore, babies they are with no understanding
whatsoever, who go to objects of the world, who think there
is pleasure there.
The objects are nooses of Yama, and whoever goes to
them is caught, like fishes get caught in a net cast out in the
ocean. Die we shall, if we go near objects!—“Dhiras, heroes,
spiritual giants, self-controlled beings who have mastered
their mind and senses, feel something immortal in the
objects of the world. They do not want objects, but That
which is hidden behind them.”
This consciousness that has been lost in objects—how
are we to extricate it? To wean the mind from things, how is
this difficult task performed? The next mantra gives a clue
to it.
Yet the Agent in All the Senses in All Conditions
yena rῡpaṁ gandhaṁ śabdān sparśāṁś ca maithunān,
etenaiva vijānāti, kim atra pariśiṣyate: etad vai tat. (3)

What is the Atman? This is the Atman: “That which is
not the object that is seen, but That which sees the object.”
Try to differentiate between the object that is seen and That
which sees. Take the example of the body: it is seen and so
it is an object. Who is seeing it? I taste a dish; but who is
tasting? Not the tongue, because it is also an object.
“Who perceives form, taste, smell, sounds and touches
of love—that Knower is different from the known.” We
must be very subtle to do this great analysis. The distinction
between consciousness and objects is Atman atma-viveka.
This body is seen. Who sees? “The senses,” you may say.
“The mind is thinking the body.” Analyse the condition of
98

the mind and senses again. You exist as the Seer of the
body. Do you exist as the bundle of senses? No, because in
the condition of dream you exist even without them. So
mind can sense things even if the senses do not operate. But
then, are you the mind?
No, because in deep sleep it does not function, and you
exist as a centre of consciousness. In what condition do you
then exist? Not as the body, not as the senses, not as the
mind, not as the intellect. You cannot say that you did not
exist in deep sleep. Mysteriously enough, we have a
memory of it. Memory is a conscious state. You cannot
remember unless you were conscious, and memory is a
remembrance of a past condition. How could you have a
conscious memory of an unconscious experience? How can
you say consciousness proceeds from matter?
Consciousness cannot emerge out of dead matter.
The conclusion is that experience can exist as mere
consciousness, even without the senses, the mind and so
on, and that it is different from them. “What remains after
cutting off all that is not consciousness? The body is not
consciousness; the senses are not consciousness. Isolate all
these. What remains then? “This, verily, is That.” This is
another method of neti-neti: “I see something; I am not that
something, because the Seer cannot be seen.” Similarly, “I
think something and I cannot be that which is thought,
because the thinker cannot be thought.” Again, “I
understand something, and I cannot be that which I
understand, because the understander cannot be the same
as the understood.”
This whole world is regarded as a jugglery of maya by
the scriptures, due to this important truth found out by this
99

analysis. We have somehow identified consciousness with
objects, and whatever value or meaning we see in things is
the Atman. When you isolate the Atman from this world,
the world does not exist. When the Atman is extended, He
is seen as this world by the senses. When He is withdrawn,
the world does not exist. Therefore, it is maya.
Mantras three, four and five of this section are
directions in the process of self-investigation, atmanatmaviveka, the way in which we dive deep into our own self.
Apart from the consciousness that sees objects, there is a
consciousness that illumines the mind, and beyond this is
Pure Consciousness. There is an essence and a form of the
world. Its substantiality is due to consciousness. Objects are
the combination of form and essence—the essence is the
Atman, and the form is the world. If the essence is
withdrawn, the form loses its substance. If you withdraw all
the clay from a pot, there is no pot. The Atman is present in
the world just as the clay is present in the pot. The forms
which we are interested in, which we perceive, are shapes
taken by consciousness in space and time due to
externalisation. We do not say that the pot is the same as
clay, nor can we say it is different from it.
This mysterious existence of the pot is maya. It is
difficult to say what the pot is; similarly, it is difficult to say
what the world is, because it has no substantiality apart
from the Atman, just as there is no pot without the clay.
Yet, the world appears. This analysis is for meditation on
the Atman: He can be—and is to be meditated upon as—
anything and everything: the Atman in the Ganges, in the
sun, in every sense-object; because it is His presence that
makes the appearance of the object and without Him, the
100

object cannot exist. The Atman can be meditated upon
both inwardly and outwardly. The drik-drisya-viveka is a
beautiful composition, attributed to Shankara: you can
enter into samadhi by withdrawing into yourself and by
projecting yourself externally. Looking at an object is,
therefore, not objectionable. Only when we see it as an
object of sense is it our enemy. So the Atman is your friend
as well as your enemy. Minus name and form what remains
in an object? Minus the name ‘pot’ and the shape ‘pot’,
what is there in a pot? Even matter is the expansion of
space and time, say the scientists, and their theory is not
new to Indian thinkers. It was also held by the Yoga
Vasishtha, which says that the whole world is nil. If you
withdraw the essence, it is like a soap-bubble. It seems
terrifying, but it is nothing, it has no substantiality. “This
internal content of you and everything is That,” says Yama
to Nachiketas.
svapnāntaṁ jāgaritāntaṁ cobhau yenānupaśyati,
mahāntaṁ vibhumātmānam matvā dhīro na śocati. (4)

“That which is the perceiver of the dream and wakinglife objects and that which is between both these states, that
is the Atman, knowing which no one grieves.” The Atman
is the witness of the waking and dream life, and also that
which links both in a mysterious manner. It is the same
person who wakes, dreams and sleeps, and the continuity
between these three states is maintained by one who is
different from them. Otherwise, it would not be possible to
experience continuity, or know what happened yesterday.
All three experiences are the contents of one single
consciousness.
101

The Atman is the perceiver in an unusual sense. In the
same way as the clay in the pot is the perceiver of the pot—
because it is its cause—so is the Atman the perceiver. If the
clay in the pot were to be endowed with consciousness,
what would it feel? For the clay in the pot there is no pot. It
is only for the onlooker that there is a pot. The potconsciousness is an externalised consciousness due to
intervention of space and time. If this is withdrawn, there is
not pot, only clay. But the difficulty is that we do not know
what this withdrawal from space and time is. We can only
know if we withdraw ourselves from space and time, which
is not easily possible. And when we do this, we enter into a
different state of consciousness.
So the Atman is non-spatial and non-temporal
existence; the substratum, independent of space and time
on account of which we experience the three states. The
Atman as such is beyond them. He is turiya. There is a
beautiful description of the Atman in the Mandukya
Upanishad: The Atman-consciousness is not projected
internally, not externally, not both ways. It is consciousness
without a content, not attached to a content. What is That?
It is a non-dual Substance which It alone knows. Here, It is
referred to as ‘mahantam’. Once this Atman is known in
realisation, there is no sorrow. All sorrow is due to
entanglement of the mind in space and time. By knowing
Him, one transcends.

102

The Universal Soul is Identical with the Individual Soul
ya imam madhvadaṁ veda ātmānaṁ jīvam antikāt,
īśāṅam bhῡta-bhavyasya, na tato vijugupsate: etad vai tat. (5)

This Atman it is that makes you feel that you are the
enjoyer of the fruits of action. We are under the impression
that we are individual doers. Madhu means honey. For us,
experience in this world is sweet like honey, and so we cling
to it. Existence is itself joy, even with all the suffering it
involves; even with all the miseries, because the Atman
reflects Himself in our lives. The taster of the honey is the
Atman, and the taste comes from Him, too. This joy of life
does not come from a distant place. The consciousness of
our being alive comes not from outside. Our life is identical
with our existence.
Once you enter into the state of the Atman which is the
nearest and so the dearest, you become the knower of the
past and future. The very same eyes that saw the
Kurukshetra Battle peep through us even today. The
Purusha Sukta gives us the highest example of this fact. It
says that all these eyes, all these heads, are His.
Omniscience is the mark of this universal being and seeing.
We shall all become like this, provided we are able to break
through the wall of personality. If, instead of limiting our
consciousness to a single body, we are able to go beyond it,
there is immediately a flood of omniscience, if only we are
able to sink into the subconscious level of our being. This
going beneath can be experienced internally or externally.
You can sink into the ocean near New York or Bombay;
you sink into the same ocean. The Atman-ocean is
everywhere, and when you once enter into Him, you will
not shrink away from Him. This is so strange!
103

Though we try to want God, there is only a try and not
the want. When God begins to look at us we are terrified,
because He will not make any concession to the senses and
their actions. We do not want Him to be critical about us,
and so we shrink away. God’s face burns like a blazing fire,
and he who enters Him, does not return. But we want to
return after God-realisation. See Him, and then become
powerful to enjoy the objects of the world, or transform it.
You do not go somewhere to see God and come back
afterwards. You do not move even a single inch to see Him.
You are not travelling to any place in God-consciousness;
don’t forget that He is everywhere.
He is omnipresent Indivisibility. Indivisibility relieves
you from space and time, and because He is omnipresent,
He is not somewhere, nor is He someone. You enter the
same God wherever you are, and in whatever time. “He is
spaceless and timeless existence. When this stage is reached,
you do not turn away from anything, nor do you crave for
anything. The senses are withdrawn automatically, the
mind ceases to be and you do not exist as a thinker or
senser, but as being—a being of omnipresent indivisibility.
This is what you experience, and this is God-consciousness.
It does not take time. It is not future, or past, but an Eternal
Presence. This mysterious something is That, O
Nachiketas!”
yaḥ pῡrvaṁ tapaso jātam adbhyaḥ pῡrvam ajāyata,
guhām praviśya tiṣṭhantam yo bhῡtebhir vyapaśyata: etad vai
tat. (6)

This ishvara, Brahman, God, Atman, is externally
visible and internally experienced. He is far and near.
Externally, to the senses, He is the most distant, and yet,
104

being your own Self, He is nearest. Cosmically speaking, He
was even prior to the idea of creation. It was by tapas that
ishvara created. But His tapas is different from ours. For us,
tapas is self-control and mental effort to subdue the senses.
But for Him, it is concentration of consciousness—
universal being taking the shape of space and time. The
substance of the world is the will of ishvara, just as the
substance of a dream-object of yours is your own thought.
Your dream-fire, your dream-water and so on are your own
creations. For God, there is no hard or liquid substance, but
only His will of which all elements are constituted. Prior to
the manifestation of the five elements, say the Puranas,
there was only universal water and the Spirit of God
brooding over it. This water is the cosmic condition, and
the Spirit is Narayana. He is so called because He gives life,
spirit, to the original condition of things. This potentiality
becomes will; Brahman becomes ishvara. Prior to the will of
hiranyagarbha’s concentrated thought is the Absolute.
Also, It is the deepest Reality in your own heart. That
Narayana is in you even now, and He broods over creation
both microcosmically and macrocosmically. He becomes
the elements and the jivas.
In dream, you are the objects and also the subject. You
yourself are the experiences of the dream-content. Likewise,
ishvara is present objectively in the cosmos, and
subjectively in you. So there need not be any worry as to
how to approach this Universal Being who is far. “He who
was born of old from austerity, from the waters—He is in
your own heart, as the bottom of your being. By diving
deep within, you can operate the whole universe. This
105

inaccessible Reality is the most secret Being in your own
being. Nachiketas, this verily is That.”
What is that which is beyond the destruction of
everything, was the question. This is That. That which is
far, far from the ken of our senses, yet is our being. It is the
most distant, unreachable, and the most inward. This is the
difficulty in God-realisation: you have to become
everything or nothing. This is your sadhana. There are
three kinds of ego: ‘I am something’; ‘I am everything’; ‘I
am nothing’. The latter two are capable of bringing
liberation. But the ego ‘I am something’ binds.
The process of creation is being described in a
graduated series: Brahman is the supreme Existence. It
becomes ishvara, and then the will to project,
hiranyagarbha, and as such, cosmic prana. Universal life
vibrating everywhere—a gross form of which is electric
energy, a part of which is our breath. Universal prana is
hiranyagarbha. He is also the abode of all gods. Every God
of every religion is one phase of this God. All gods hang in
the universal Tree of hiranyagarbha like leaves, fruits,
flowers hang in the same tree. This universal tree is what is
described in the fifteenth chapter of the Gita. All Gods are
appearances or shapes of this One God. This God, in which
all gods exist, exists in your own heart. So you can see all
gods of all times, anywhere, sitting in one place: Krishna,
Rama, Shiva, Christ, Buddha. That which is without is also
within: Tat tvam asi. That cosmic reality is the subjective
reality also.
God is above as well as below. Cosmically, He is ishvara
and hiranyagarbha. Individually, He is our own Self. We
usually are under the impression that the sky is very far,
106

that space is above and that stars are in space. But we forget
that we are in space, in the sky; hanging in mid-air. If the
moon and stars are far off in the skies to us, similarly the
earth is in distant space to them. Just as they seem to be
hanging in space thousands of miles away, we too seem
hanging in space to them. We feel we are on the earth, and
space is far, far away; but the fact is that it is everywhere. It
is in this indivisible, conscious space that we feel God. The
ideas of below and above, of distance and nearness, and
finally, the conditions we impose on space have affected us
so much that even in universally existing Reality we make
the distinction of below and above, and philosophically we
distinguish between Brahman and ishvara, ishvara and jiva,
macrocosm and microcosm, this and that, tat and idam—
which are all notional differences.
The omnipotent Reality has centres everywhere. You
can think through any point in space, for each is as good as
any other. One circle has only one centre because it has
only one circumference. But this is not a circle with a
boundary. It may be a circle from the point of view of
boundless existence, but it is filled with Selfhood and as
such cannot be differentiated into good and bad, just as
oneself cannot become an object. The Self is ever a subject,
and inasmuch as It is the centre, It has centres everywhere.
This God, Reality, which we seek, is the universal Creator,
prior even to the manifestation of the five elements,
tanmatras, and the cosmic causal condition, and yet,
mysteriously enough, at the same time this most distant
Being is the bottommost Existence in our heart.

107

yā prāṇena sambhavaty aditir devatāmayī,
guhām praviśya tiṣṭhantī, yā bhῡtebhir vyajāyata: etad vai

“This Supreme Being is not merely the transcendent
presence called Brahman, He is not merely the Supreme
called ishvara, He is also the cosmic prana, the life of all
beings.” The life we breathe, the energy that we breathe, is
all the expression of this hiranyagarbha-prana. It is the
cosmic prana that is breathed, by all—by people, plants,
animals etc., all move because of the prana that enlivens
them. Life does not mean living in a world. It is not activity
of any kind. To live is itself life, not merely to do
something, or to speak or execute a deed. Life is the
capacity to exist as different from manifested matter. It is
not protoplasm; it is not thought. Prana and life are only
different words meaning the same. And it is difficult to
explain how a human being or animal differs from
inanimate matter, just as it is difficult to prove that we exist.
All that is connected with God is mysterious.
When you cross the logical limits of the intellect,
everything becomes inexplicable. If externally there is no
limit to the horizon, internally there is no limit to wisdom.
Wisdom is endless as space is endless. God is limitless
externally and internally. One of His expressions is this
mysterious something which we call prana, through which
living bodies move from place to place and recognise
themselves. To recognise oneself as living is life. Even
plants have a self-direction: they grow and move towards
the light of the sun. It may not be a thinking principle, but a
tendency of self-recognition which is called life or prana.
“This cosmic life is hiranyagarbha-prana, in which all gods
108

are clustered together. This mysterious hiranyagarbha is in
your heart also. And this Being was prior to manifestation,
and It entered the beings. This verily is That.”
In the earlier mantra we were told that He was prior to
the manifestation of the physical elements, the tanmatras,
to all that is conceivable. Now He is said to have entered all.
The body is made up of elements, and the life in it is due to
prana entering them. This way, hiranyagarbha is That
reality behind all forms of life.
araṇyor nihito jāta-vedā garbha iva subhṛto garbhiṇībhiḥ:
dive diva īḍyo jāgṛvadbhir haviṣmadbhir manuṣyebhir agniḥ:
etad vai tat. (8)

“This hiranyagarbha, called vaishvanara-agni in the
aranyakas and nachiketas agni here, hidden in fire-sticks
like the embryo in pregnant women, should be daily
adored; this verily is That.” It is the jatharagni that digests
the food in our stomach. It is the fivefold fire that functions
through the five sense organs. The nabhi is supposed to be
the centre of it; a living force. This mystical fire is hidden in
the two aranis. In a sense you may say fire is hidden in a
matchstick. In olden days it was created by the ignition of
two sticks—the upper and lower aranis are the two sections
of the mathava which ignites fire and keeps it hidden in
them. One stick is not enough; two are necessary. Jatavedas
is agni. Just as rubbing or friction is necessary to ignite fire,
some sort of igniting force is necessary to manifest
hiranyagarbha. We have Him in us; we carry Him with us
always; just as pregnant women carry the foetus in their
wombs wherever they go, we move about with Him, and we
cannot live without Him.
109

This Supreme That Is within us, we worship It, though
unknowingly. We cry for It, every day. We long and die for
It—but unconsciously. Our searches in the world indicate
that we cannot live without this Being. Our suffering, our
complaints indicate that we cannot live without Him. Our
wealth and possessions indicate that we cannot live without
Him. Hiranyagarbha is the Infinite in us, and the many
finitudes we collect from this world cannot make us happy.
Likewise, all the visible material things collected by us
cannot be equated with the Universal we are carrying. With
this treasure within, we seek for It outside.
What we need is an awakening! Awakened ones
recognise this Being within, and unawakened ones search
for It outside. What is needed is not a possession of the
treasure, but a realisation of the fact that we possess it. If an
emperor dreams that he is a beggar, what are we to do to
make him rich? Are we to give him riches in the dream?
No—he is only to be awakened and told that he is an
emperor. And the very same instruction is for us: We
possess the universal treasure in us; we have enough. To
become rich in the universal sense we need not acquire
many things. The universal wealth must be made part of
our consciousness. This is how awakened ones worship It,
while unawakened ones worship It as sense objects.
The distorted worship performed by the ignorant by
searching for happiness in these is not going to help them
in any way; just as a beggars’ wandering in the dream world
is not going to help him to become rich. Awakening, and
not contact with things is the way to possess universal
wealth. To wake up into another consciousness is the
solution. This fire of awakening has to be ignited. Ishvara110

sakshatkara or the awareness that one is the Universal—
that conflagration which is in every matchstick—is what is
necessary. This awakened Reality is verily That.
This agni is symbolically worshipped by the
householders as the fivefold agni, even today, but it has
become only a ritual. People mistake this earthly fire as the
real, instead of recognising it as the universal fire. But the
agni that we worship is a symbol of the vaishvanara-agni.
Life is prana manifesting itself as energies of various kinds,
just as electricity can be manifest as heating or freezing
force, and so on.This mysterious living Being within
individual bodies is That answer to Nachiketas’ question
about hiranyagarbha.
yataś codeti śuryo astam yatra ca gacchati,
taṁ devās sarve’rpitās tadu nātyeti kaś cana: etad vai tat. (9)

Yama continues: “The sun sets there, the sun rises from
there; the propelling force behind the sun which makes it
rise and set is that force which all the gods worship daily.
No one goes beyond That. This verily is That.” All gods are
fixed in this one God, like spokes connected to the hub of a
wheel; it can also be compared to, radii connected to the
centre of a circle. This Energy is the cause of all movement,
not only in this world, but even in the stellar system. This
mantra is the description of the controlling Power of the
physical cosmos. Gravitation is the force that acts between
bodies. We are stunned by its mysterious laws working in
the heavenly bodies, causing their motion through aeons
and aeons. If ‘A’ is attracted by ‘B’, and ‘B’ is conversely
attracted by ‘A’, we say they are mutually attracting each
other. If there are three bodies involved, we cannot say
which attracts what. If there are ten such bodies, the
111

problem is more complicated. If there are innumerable
bodies, how can we explain the gravitational law? This
mutual attraction among bodies, which yet keep their
courses, indicates the existence of a central governing
Power. Otherwise, there would be no mutual attraction and
planets would run helter-skelter. There would be no
centripetal force which pulls everything to the centre,
keeping all in their track. The planets are seen, but not the
force that keeps them moving. By the term, ‘sun’, we have
to understand all heavenly bodies.
What is the law that keeps all cells in the body intact?
Why do they not run away? We have never seen cells in the
body fighting with each other. Why do they react
chemically and otherwise? Why should there be a relation
between effect and cause? All this is due to this central
Force or Energy on which everything is hung and on which
everything depends. This is the God of all gods. Everything
valuable in this world and the celestial one is determined by
This. No one can break Its Law. No one can exceed It.
There is no such thing as violation of It. This Reality is that
Supreme Being.
Failure to Comprehend the Essential Unity of Being
is the Cause of Rebirth
yad eveha tad amutra yad amutra tad anviha,
mṛtyos sa mṛtyum āpnoti ya iha nāneva paśyati. (10)

“To this Universal Being there is no near and far. What
is there is here, and what is here is there. Who perceives
manyfoldness, goes from death to death.” If you go to the
Pacific Ocean, you find water everywhere—above, below,
112

after a hundred miles. In the Universal, everything is
everywhere.
What you can see after travelling millions and millions
of miles, you can see right here, and what you can see after
many births, you can see now. If anyone makes any
distinction in this infinite Reality, he will enter into death
because of the false notion he created. Birth and death
cannot be obviated as long as there is attraction and
repulsion, and they cannot be avoided as long as many
things are perceived. So do not be under the misconception
that there are many things here. All these forms are the
forms of the One thing only.
This mantra describes another aspect of the Glory of the
Supreme Being. In the Supreme Absolute, there are no
distinctions of any kind, as you observe among the things
of the world. It is a mysterious sameness. Whatever
reference we make in this world, all is defined in terms of
objects that are extended in space and attributed to one
another. We have differences as well as uniformities in the
world, but neither of these obtains in God. The differences
are of three kinds: between two dissimilar objects, vijatiyabheda, as between man and animal; between one man and
another man, between one tree and another tree, sajatiyabheda; internal distinction, such as between one eye and
another, one limb and another in the same man, svagatabheda. All these are differences of some kind or another.
Yet there is a uniformity in the whole body of ours on
account of which we are one person and have an equal
attitude towards all the limbs of our body. But the presence
of God is of a different type altogether, and ishvaratva is
defined as sarvatmatva, sarvadesikatva—Omnipresence
113

attended with Universal Selfhood is God’s Universality of
Presence. What is relevant to God cannot be said because
no one has seen Him.
In the Gita, God’s uniformity is mentioned: ‘sarvatah
panipadam tat sarvato kshishiromukham...’ In the Rig
Veda, it is said: ‘sahasrasirsha purushah, sahasrakshah
sahasrapat...’ descriptions of God’s uniformity in terms of
human language. He has eyes everywhere, and also ears,
legs, etc., everywhere. It is a quantitative contradiction
which is not acceptable in logic. But God’s eyes are
everywhere, and there He has ears, too, meaning to say that
in one spot in space He has eyes, ears and so on. A most
strange thing! If eyes are everywhere, ears cannot be there!
How can they all be present in one place? An impossibility
for us! But such is His existence, at the same time pointing
out that He has no eyes, etc., because He does not need
them. He has no physical eyes. All our arms spread
everywhere will not equal God’s spreading His arms. He is
not a quantitative collection of all our arms. And His
perception is different from ours. If all persons look at an
object, it will not be an intuition, but God’s perception is
intuition.
This is the difference between God’s omniscience and
the sensations of an individual. Human sensation is
debarred from an entry into the object of perception: our
ears cannot enter the sound they hear, nor can our eyes
enter the objects seen. Human perception is therefore not
anubhava in the spiritual sense. We cannot see without the
help of light-rays, but God can see. Similarly, He can move
without legs. While the Gita says He has eyes everywhere,
the Upanishad says He has no eyes and yet He sees
114

everything. A single point in space, as subtle as an atom,
becomes resplendent with the intelligence which is God’s
Substance. That resplendence of God’s presence is
simultaneous knowledge of all matter.
We have to open our eyes to see, and need ears to hear
and a nose to smell to get the diverse knowledge of the
sense objects. Our knowledge is a joint action of the five
senses, and if we had more than five, it would be possible to
know more facets of the same object. But ishvara-jnana is
anubhava. It is satta of the objects. Therefore, He is called
satchidananda: the very existence of the object is His
existence. He is everywhere in the same intensity—not that
God is here and not there, is now and not then. He is the
same in all relations. Our relationships are different from
person to person, but His is equal and the same to all. But
this uniformity is not the same as that of water in the ocean
which we get tired of seeing because it is a dead and
monotonous sameness. This uniformity is a gorgeous
variety, a tremendous richness which anyone can conceive
of in any way. Such is the majestic uniformity and
abundance which make the supreme existence of God.
But in this omnipresence, in this equality, in this
indivisibility, our senses create a difference which leads to
death. To them, something is here and something not, and
due to this there is sensory activity for possession and
enjoyment. Inasmuch as difference is created where it is
not, because it is a false creation, the soul is bound and
suffers because Truth alone triumphs, and not falsehood.
So, in the Supreme Reality which is everywhere, if one is to
make a false distinction, he cannot avoid death.
115

manasaivedam āptavyaṁ neha nānāsti kiñ cana:
mṛtyos sa mṛtyuṁ gacchati ya iha nāneva paśyati. (11)

In the Gita we are told: ‘sukhamatyantikam yattad
budhhirgrahyam atindriyam ....’ A similar thing is said here:
“This majesty of God cannot be seen by the senses, but can
be grasped by the higher, purified mind.”
Reflection brought about by the sattva guna alone can
reveal knowledge. While tamas prevents knowledge
completely, rajas distracts. Tamas may be compared to a
glass painted with coal tar, thus not allowing light to pass,
as it happens to us in deep sleep. But rajas is like a broken
or corrugated glass. It allows light, but the light is not
straight. The light becomes bent or distorted; it gets
projected in a diverted way. Both are not conducive to
knowledge. But in sattva, light passes through a clarified
medium which is transparent enough to give a clear picture
of reality. Though reality is transcendent to the senses,
sattva is capable of giving an idea of it. It is rajas that
creates a distinction. “He whose senses do not see the truth,
goes from death to death perpetually, due to the necessity
of fulfilling unfulfilled desires, brought about by a false
perception of variety.”
The Eternal Lord Abiding In One's Self
aṅguṣṭha-mātraḥ puruṣo madhya ātmani tiṣṭhati:
īśāno bhῡta-bhavyasya na tato vijigupsate: etad vai tat. (12)

“This Supreme Absolute, Brahman, is also the Atman of
all beings. Of the size of a thumb, He resides in the middle
of the body.” This mysterious Existence, God, cosmically
present and extra-cosmically pervading, is also in one’s
heart. When He enters the heart, He is the Atman, present
116

there in a special manner: ever a Seer and never a seen. He
is satta-samanya; the same in all. He is the light in
everything, on account of which the Atman is seen. God
never becomes an object, and so no one can see Him; He
sees. When He reveals Himself as the Atman, He appears to
be located in that part of the body, but He is not so located.
When the sun is reflected in various pots filled with water,
many suns will be seen reflected in them and one may
wrongly feel that there are many suns. Similarly one may be
under the impression that the Atman is many. Our bodies
are like a vessel containing the thought process or mind in
which the Supreme reflects in a mysterious manner.
From this point of apparent localisation in the body,
and on account of the secondary process of thought, the
Atman is described as angusthamatra, or the size of a
thumb. When the sun is reflected in an ounce-glass, she
appears to be of that size. It is said in psychophysical
science that our body is constituted of centres of nerve
current, and that some are narrow and some broad, some
more transparent than others. If water passes through an
iron tube it will not be visible, but it will be visible in a
plastic tube. Certain nerve currents in the heart, brain etc.,
which are known only to the mystics or yogins and not to
the scientists, are very transparent, and when the
intelligence within us passes through them as it does
through every part of the body, there appears to be a larger
intensity of light manifestation. So we are told in a
figurative or special sense that intelligence is present there,
because it is made visible only in these places. Intelligence is
stronger felt between the eyebrows, in the throat and heart.
These are the centres of the waking, dream and sleep states.
117

It enters the heart when we are asleep, or in death or the
super-conscious state. From this point of view it is said that
the size of the Atman is as a thumb.
There is a lot of controversy on this subject. Some say
the Atman is only in one part of the body, and some others
say that it is all over it, just like even though the candle
stands in one place its light will fill the whole room. All
these ideas are wrong because the Universal cannot be only
somewhere; it is everywhere. It manifests as the Atman or
the knowing Self and passes as a separate being on account
of the limitations of the mind and senses.
When this Supreme Master of the past, present and
future is known, we will not only turn away from
everything, we will also not want anything of this world.
“Once having beheld the majesty of God, you will want
nothing of this world.” Just as once you get up from dream
you do not want to enter it again, likewise once having seen
It you will not want to see anything of this world—like
Dhritarashtra, who requested Krishna to take away his
eyesight after having beheld His divine form, lest he should
see anything else.
aṅguṣṭha-mātraḥ puruṣo jyotir ivādhῡmakaḥ,
īśāno bhῡta-bhavyasya sa evādya sa u śvaḥ: etad vai tat. (13)

“This so-called angushthamatra purusha, Supreme God
lodged in bodies, minds, intellects, is a flame without
smoke, resplendence alone, devoid of shadow.” People who
have beheld this Light, have given testimony in various
ways. Some say it is like a flash of lightening blinding one’s
eyes. Some describe it as a steady golden light like that of
the rising sun. Some say it is cool like that of the moon.
Some say it is like a star twinkling in the space of one’s
118

heart. Some say it is a flame without smoke. Not only the
visions, but also the sounds we hear as we approach the
Atman, are described in different scriptures. “This marvel is
the Master of past, present and future. He is always the
same, today and tomorrow.” A grand immediacy of
Presence and Wealth which can be described only as
Omnipresence.
The descriptions of the Atman in this Upanishad are
not exhaustive because not everything can be said in a
textbook. All descriptions of all the scriptures put together
cannot describe fully the Glory of God, such is His Infinite
Might. But the word ‘infinite’ has been so much used that it
has lost its meaning. Larger than the widest of spaces, more
intensively rich than anything you have seen—all this is
ishvara. People go mad on account of the indescribability of
His Glory. Some mystics say that when He enters this body,
it is like an elephant entering a thatched rut, breaking it
into pieces. The body cannot bear it. It is said that
Ramakrishna Paramhamsa suffered from his final illness on
account of repeated God-experience. Everything in regard
to God is a marvel: How to meditate on Him, how He
comes, how He is, how we behold Him.
Inasmuch as we know the great Reality as It has been
described, to pursue a path that is contrary to Its nature
would be adharma or unrighteous. Unrighteousness is all
activity that is directed against the nature of the Atman,
primarily a forgetfulness of His supremacy within. This
forgetfulness hardens into a self-affirmation of
individuality, or jiva. This, again, materialises into love and
hatred, and actions determined by these instead of by Him.
When He determines our actions, we are said to perform
119

dharma, and when love and hate determine them, we are
said to perform adharma. This is the secret of righteousness
and unrighteousness.
The Results of Seeing Diversity or Unity
yathodakam durge vṛṣṭam parvateṣu vidhāvati,
evaṁ dharmān pṛthak paśyaṁs tān evānuvidhāvati. (14)

“Just as rain that falls on the crest of the mountain may
be scattered into many streams of water rushing forth in
different directions, all getting dissipated and not collected;
so the energies or the intelligence of a person gets
distributed and channelised in many says, exhausting him
thoroughly.”
Like a rivulet moving in the forest, the senses of the jiva
direct his energies without any aim. The objects of the
world are constructions of these diversified runnings of the
intellect, endowed with a practical utilitarian value,
vyavaharika-satta, but having no reality in themselves
(paramartika-satta). Things in the world have value and
meaning so long as they are related to us. Hence, they have
a relative value. When the constituents change, the values
change, because there is no fundamental reference to
consciousness. We are living in a state of motion, just as the
rushing torrents which have no being of their own, except
their motion. When they do not move, they will have no
existence. Man has no knowledge of what is happening to
him. There is a fundamental ignorance which covers our
substantiality. When the parts which make our personality
return to their sources, we cease to be an individual.
Because motion is mistaken for being, the world is called an
illusion.
120

The dharmas mentioned in this verse are the qualities
and relations that determine the world. Objects are not
substances, but relations. As we found out before, they
appear as solid because their velocity cannot be grasped by
the mind, and so it is stupefied when it is presented with
them who are the gunas of prakriti. And so, the world is
indeterminable. This doctrine of anatma-vada is extended
even to the ego; not even it is substance. A cosmic illusion
of the world’s substantiality is presented to all of us. The
same sickness seems to afflict the whole of humanity, and
therefore a common remedy is prescribed. While mantra
fourteen tells of the sickness, mantra fifteen describes the
remedy.
Our mistake is to take objects for solid, letting our
consciousness getting lost in the world, just as water falling
from mountain tops gets dissipated. Consciousness rushes
forth in various stages and passes through various
mediums—the universal consciousness getting tethered to a
personal centre which is called ego, just as the sun’s light
gets projected through an aperture in a ceiling, looking
weak and small. Not only this: it concretises and
materialises concretises and materialises further and
becomes the thinking mind, the energizing prana, the
senses of cognition and action, and finally the physical
body, landing itself into the world of objects, descending
from the realm of the heavens. We have forgotten our
grand Father, God, and are aware of this material world.
This is the state of all beings when they run to objects,
mistaking them for substances.
yathodakaṁ śuddhe śuddham āsiktaṁ tādṛg eva bhavati,
evaṁ muner vijānata ātmā bhavati gautama. (15)
121

“Just as water poured into water becomes water alone,
so the self of one who has understanding becomes the
Supreme.” If the water falling from a mountain top were to
collect and move towards the ocean, it would be one with
the ocean. Likewise does the consciousness that collects
itself, rather than dissipates itself, bring itself to a focus of
power and joins the ocean of consciousness. When our
thoughts are determined by the ocean of consciousness, we
are dhira purushas, our actions become self-determined.
When we are rooted in ego-consciousness, we become
divided into bodies and objects. One who has love for a
hundred people and things is like someone cut into a
hundred persons. Though physically he may appear as one,
psychologically he is split up, because we are what our
mind is. Our personality gets dispersed, and when this goes
too far, we become sick.
Everyone is sick in one way or another, because no one
thinks of one thing always. If the mind and intellect did not
draw their sustenance from objects but from their own
source, they would be self-determined and not objectdetermined. At present we are determined by the objects of
the world. This is not independence. Independence would
be self-determined. Likewise is this process of selfcollection: while samsara is the movement of mind in the
direction of objects, moksha would be the opposite, the
reverse of it; the collection of consciousness and merging it
into Consciousness. A knowing person becomes the Atman
of all. Just as many drops become water in the ocean, many
thoughts collect themselves in the Atman. This is the
condition of a knower, called jivanmukti, O Nachiketas.
Thus have I explained to you what you have asked.
122

SECTION 2 – THE STAGES OF SELF-CONTROL
In this chapter, the Upanishad proceeds to explain the
stages of self-control and the recognition of the Atman in
one’s day-to-day life. The various sections deal with
different aspects of the same question: self-discipline and
meditation are described throughout. Here, the Upanishad
commences with the analysis of a particular type,
pertaining to the individual body. How are we to perform
self-control, atmavinigraha? It is nothing but a
remembrance of the various functions taking place in our
body, instead of forgetting them on account of a
tremendous attraction to objects outside. We seem to forget
ourselves. We are wise about others, but not about
ourselves. We have to be wise in regard to ourselves,
instead of being wise about others.
The Real Soul of the Individual and Creation
puram ekādāś-advāram ajasyāvakra-cetasaḥ,
anuṣṭhāya na śocati vimuktasca vimucyate: etad vai tat. (1)

“A city of eleven gates belongs to the uncrooked
intelligence. By ruling it, one does not grieve.” This body
has eleven gates. What are the eleven gates of this bodycity? Some say the eleven orifices in the bodily system are
the two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, mouth, the two of
evacuation, navel and the crown of the head. But these are
gates of only the gross body. There are also eleven gates in
the subtle body, the eleven senses: five jnanendriyas, five
karmendriyas, and the mind.
So this city of the human personality is endowed with
eleven openings, and consciousness can rush out through
any of these. It can rush forth if there is even one gate; what
123

to say if there are eleven! It splits up and moves. But this
light within is not elevenfold. It is single, and it is not
channelised, just as the space in a vessel is not limited to its
walls. If a violent wind blows, it is not blown out. His light
is always straight, and it is never extinguished. Our body is
perpetually illumined by this light within. It does not bend
with the body or get destroyed when the latter disintegrates.
It does not get affected with the affections of the body.
Nothing on earth or in heaven can affect light. This light is
avikara aja. One cannot restrict it as one can the things of
the world. Though it illumines the eleven gates and also the
things outside them, it is unaffected by what happens in the
body and around it.
This bodily city is to be the object of one’s self-study.
He who analyses the constitution of it will not grieve any
more. The physical body is made of the five elements, the
gross bhutas: earth, water, fire, air and ether. It is the
combination and permutation of them. Its constitution is
the same as that of the world: the body is inert as earth is. It
is endowed with light, power and motion, activity and
sensation, just as a material medium may be charged with
electric force. The body becomes a live wire by life-force,
and is called jiva. The five elements do not possess this
energy which may be called life. Hence, the human body is
more than these elements. The vitality in us is a special
thing. Not only that, we have various sensations which
other living beings do not have. We establish a traffic
between ourselves and the world outside through these
gates of the senses. Through them, we move out of the body
and go to the world, receive commodities and bring them
into it. The world enters into us and we rush out; a
124

perpetual commerce takes place. If the gates were not there,
there would be no commerce and no jiva. The jiva within
lacks contents, and the world outside lacks vitality. They
supply to each other what they need.
This mantra explains Kant’s philosophy. We carry on
this traffic with the outer world: it supplies contents, and
we supply forms. This fact of mutual existence was already
described in the Upanishad. The jiva is unhappy because he
seems to lack something which the world contains, some
objects that he needs. But you want meaning to be attached
to them which you have to supply. So your consciousness
pervades the object so much that it is mistaken for the
need—like the iron ball that is charged with heat seems to
be fire itself—and thus the world and the inner
consciousness form samsara. This is the essence of our
world-experience. Let one meditate on this.
Do not be a slave of this traffic; to be a witness to it,
performing anushthana in this very birth, consciousness
should visualise itself as the supreme Lifegiver of all things,
for without it, they would disintegrate. When it combines
itself with the elements, it becomes a jiva, and when it
separates itself from them, it becomes liberation: the freed
ones get free. “This, verily, is That.”
haṁsaḥ śuciṣat, vasur antarikṣasat hotā vediṣat, atithir
duroṇasat,
nṛṣat, varasat, ṛtasat, vyomasat, abjā, gojā, ṛtajā, adrijā, ṛtam
bṛhat. (2)

This is a quotation from the Rig Veda and from the
Yajur Veda, a description of the Atman, to be reached by
anushthana. Inwardly He is the Self, and outwardly, He is
ishvara. The purport of it is that the Atman is all-pervading,
125

omnipresent. This is suddha satta, the Abode of Pure Being.
“He moves as air in the sky; He is the pervader of space, the
priest and the guest that you see daily; He is what you call
man, He is what you call woman; He is what you call law in
this world; He is all-pervading ether; He is what you call
water, what you call earth; He is what you call mountain.
He is what you call truth par excellence. He is what is called
the Great Reality; He is what you call Atman. All things,
right from heaven to earth, are vitalised and pervaded by
the Atman.” First, we have the word ‘shuchishat’, etc. He is
in heaven, in earth, in air, in fire, in ether and in all the
contents of the world, not only in the physical ones, but
also in all the laws that operate in all qualities and relations,
in everything that has significance. He is not only in the
external and internal, but also in the relation that obtains
between them; not only in the relation, but the as relation
itself. He is the perceiver, the perceived and the process of
perception, and at the same time transcends this threefold
process.
In the second mantra, the Atman is described as not
only the pervasive principle in all creation, but also the
contents which He pervades. This will suffice to remove
many misconceptions in regard to Him. That which is the
Self of all beings is regarded by people as limited. They
imagine the Atman to be inside the body. It is wrong to so
think, because He is that which is Universal and Absolute.
The ideas of inside and outside are created by the process of
psychological and intellectual thinking. Hence, it would be
like putting the cart before the horse if we think that the
Atman is located inside the body. He is neither inside nor
outside. He is the pervasive Principle and the Substance
126

through which He circulates. He does not pervade the
universe like water pervading a cloth; He is not one thing
entering another. This omnipresence of sarvatrata of the
Atman described as pervading all things is for the purpose
of explanation, inasmuch as it cannot be described in any
other manner. The Atman is the Self. The Supreme Being is
called the Atman because It cannot be visualised by the
senses and It is prior to all concepts. Inasmuch as It is prior
to everything, presupposing all activities of cognition and
perception, all our faculties being external forms of It, such
being Its marvellous pervasive character, it was best to call
It the Atman of all things.
Again and again, the perverse mind wants the same
thing it wanted before. It clings to the ideas of internal and
external, and these ideas do not leave us. People look within
the body or physical frame to see the Atman. He is within
in a different sense altogether. Lord Jesus said: “The
Kingdom of Heaven is within.” How can a kingdom be
within? It sounds absurd. But it is a spiritually conceived
‘within’ rather than the physical walled within.
It is the habit of the eyes to look within in a physical
sense, and they want to see the Atman in this way alone. He
is internal not only to the eyes, but also to the mind. Hence,
even a psychological introversion is not enough, because
the mind also introverts in space. Just as the eyes can see
objects only in space and time, so is the case with the mind,
too. The supreme Spirit is subtler than even the mind in the
sense that He does not think as the mind thinks. To think is
to separate the objects from Him.
He is within in a universal sense. If you could conceive
of the universal within, that would be the Atman. He is not
127

internal in a spatial sense, and not external in the sense of
time. He is not endless expanse in space, or passage of time
endlessly projected forward. The mind is habituated to
think in terms of space, time and causality, and thus we try
to do the same thing with the Atman.
Even the topmost heavens are pervaded by Him, so you
must bar the idea that He is within the body. He is purest
uncontaminated Being, untouched by the dust of earth and
heaven. He enlightens the highest heights. And downward
from them is the ethereal region, also pervaded by Him. He
is the cosmic principle, besides being the life- principle. He
is in the five elements. He is also vitality, and all things that
move on earth.
He is not merely the Pervader, but also the Material of
which the universe is made, as well as its material Cause.
He is its regulating laws: the physical ones, the biological
ones and all the others as well, called rita and satya. The
latter is law existing as the Atman, the former is the law
manifested in this universe. All our laws must be in
conformity with rita, and are meant to regulate the
movement of people and bring about a balance of forces as
manifestations of the supreme Harmoniser. This Atman is
the largest of all Beings, and also the smallest one,
pervading, as the Substance, all alike.
ῡrdhvam prāṇam unnayaty apānam pratyag asyati,
madhye vāmanam āsīnaṁ viśve devā upāsate. (3)

He is not merely the cosmic principle and the regulator
of cosmic activity. All activities, even in the human system,
are regulated by the Atman; even our breath, He being the
integrating principle in us. “He moves the prana up and
casts out the apana, the ramifications of the vital force in
128

us, He, the dwarf seated in the middle, adored by the gods.”
We know from our day-to-day life how this energy
pervades the whole body. Every part of it is filled with light.
We are aware of every part of our system, and in order to
make this body active, to give it the energy of locomotion,
to make the legs move, the eyes see and the other senses do
their respective work, the pranas fill it with rajas, the force
of activity. The prana is pushed out, and the apana is drawn
in. Thus you cannot help breathing in and out, every
moment, and you have no control over your internal
system which is directed by someone different altogether.
We should not be under the impression that the pranas give
us life. They are sent in different directions by the silent
Being inside who is Himself not visible, like an absolute
ruler who may send out his army or emissary. It is He who
gets forth the prana on account of which all action is done:
vamana, the silent Atman—most delightful and
resplendent.
When He acts through the representatives which are
the senses, desires are manifest. When He takes possession
of us through any one of them exclusively, we are captured
by a rapture. It may be caused by a sensory or mental
activity, as in music, beautiful scenery, a masterpiece of
literature. And then, you feel an elation wherein all five
senses are hushed. Beauty can manifest in art or senseenjoyment which is binding; but the highest rapture comes
when in spiritual ecstasy the beauty of the Atman manifests
internally; pure, non-sensory, independent of contact with
mind and senses. Neither they nor the prana or apana are
working then, but only that which brings illumination of
the whole being.
129

While the senses and prana are activated by this silent
Witness within, it is not to be forgotten that everything is
subservient to Him. All gods, meaning all the senses,
worship Him outwardly. He is silent. He does not act in a
way we can understand. His existence is charged with a
power that is enough to energise the whole universe. So the
true worship of God would be to adore Him in all things, as
all gods: vishva deva—not this or that god. He is the prana
within and without; being inside as the senses and outside,
cosmically, as the sutratman.
asya visraṁsamānasya śarīrasthasya dehinaḥ,
dehād vimucyamānasya kim atra pariśiṣyate: etad vai tat. (4)

“When this Being separates Himself from the body and
is released, what happens to the body, and what remains in
the end?” The body’s beauty is that of the Atman, and when
He is withdrawn, there is no beauty left. All the bodily parts
are integrated by Him, and when He leaves, there is decay
and decomposition, and they go back to their sources, the
elements. Yama gives here a twofold answer. When the two
exist together, there is what is called a personality, jivatva,
and they seem integrated. When the two get separated, the
body goes to its physical sources, and in His ultimate
separation, the Atman goes to the Atman. Birth is nothing
but the animation of the mind and senses by the light of the
Atman, and death is separation. When it takes place, there
is on one side physical death, and on the other, spiritual
segregation of the connection between mind and Atman.
The mind acts as a twofold link: to the body and to
Him. It can peep within as well as without. When it looks
outward through the physical senses, it becomes impure,
the lower mind or asuddha-manas. When it looks within,
130

independent of them, it becomes the higher mind, suddhamanas. That is why, though it is the cause of our bondage,
it can also be the cause of our liberation.
In empirical death, the subtle body gets isolated from
the physical one. Here, the contact of the Atman with the
mind, does not end; only the physical body is cast off. The
subtle and causal bodies remain, and they are the cause of
samsara. The causal body is the anandamaya kosha into
which we enter in deep sleep. As long as those two persist,
transmigration for the sake of enjoying karmas cannot
cease.
While empirical death is the separation from the
physical sheath by the mind and the Atman, spiritual death
is the separation of the Atman from the mind. When this
isolation takes place ultimately, in the atyantika pralaya,
the final death of individuality, which is moksha, what
remains? When all that is external is left behind, what
remains? All apparent restrictions of consciousness cease,
and the Atman recognises His pristine, original
Universality.
na prāṇena nāpānena martyo jīvati kaś cana,
itareṇa tu jīvanti, yasminn etāv upāśritau. (5)

“We do not live by prana or apana, but by something
else, on which the prana and apana live.” If we live on
prana and apana; on what do they live? That even the gods
live on the Supreme Being is illustrated in the
Kenopanishad; we do not live merely by sense-activity, by
mental functions, by our intellect: all these fail us one day
or the other; all these live on something else. This is to be
contemplated upon.

The Appropriate Embodiment of the Reincarnating Soul
hanta ta idaṁ pravakṣyāmi guhyam brahma sanātanam:
yathā ca maraṇam prāpya ātmā bhavati gautama. (6)

Nachiketas, I shall describe to you the mystery of the
Atman, and where the soul goes after death.” What
happens to a person after death—this answer is attempted
to be given in the following mantras. What happens will be
determined by the condition of the present and past. It is
said that a straight answer cannot be given, because what
was in store even before the birth of this body must be
taken into consideration.
Since many karmas are being performed—as is usually
done by everyone—and since they are done under different
impulses: intense, middling and mild, the intense ones
create deep-seated impressions in the subconscious mind,
but a mild thought produces a mild impression. Every
thought is recorded; none gets lost. These impressions are
determining factors of the soul’s reincarnation. Strong ones
may seek expression earlier than others. It is not that
present ones will be taken first, necessarily; it depends on
the intensity. For karmas there is no past and present.
When they produce an effect called apurva, subtle potency,
they get buried in the unconscious and subconscious levels
and we do not know what is in store; very powerful ones
can express themselves even in this birth, rising to the
conscious level.
It is difficult to escape the nemesis of our thoughts, acts
and feelings; we are answerable to them. Like our children,
they will claim their due share. These karmas are obstinate,
powerful and violent if they are given long ropes, and they
will hurl us into samsara as they have done now. We
132

cannot say what our next birth will be like because it cannot
be said now what karmas will be allotted to us. Jadabharata
became a deer, Ahalya a stone and Yamalarjuna the trees.
This means that human consciousness can sink to the
animal, vegetable and inanimate levels under certain given
conditions, but they will revert to the human one again.
When the body dies, all these collected impressions
awake and rise to the conscious level, demanding their
share; and this is prarabdha karma meaning new birth.
Because we do fresh karmas then, too—as we do not
remain a witness to the events—we keep adding new ones.
So karmas are fresh actions done with the sense of doer and
enjoyership, and mantras six and seven are some sort of
reflection on this subject.
The urge for reincarnation testifies to the immortality
of the soul. It never ceases its effort toward its liberation,
and this effort takes the form of a series of births and
deaths, outwardly manifesting the internal nature of its
constitution. The soul never gets the supreme satisfaction it
hopes for in this endless process of achievements. All its
efforts are unfortunately directed by error, and so instead of
immortality, there are only endless reincarnations. Things
are connected by a perpetual bond of affinity, and
emotional affections are propelled by the existence of
internal unity. This internal union of things and persons
manifests as loves outside. While this spiritual internal
unity is the reality, it takes the form of an external
attraction and pull when it manifests in the world. The
ocean at the bottom is one, but if its waters are being let out
through different channels, it can be split.
133

Human beings, all beings in the phenomenal world, are
incapable of diving into this unity at the bottom. They are
floating on the surface because their senses are being
directed outward right from the time of creation, as
mentioned in an earlier mantra; and only a few turn
inward. Birth and death are correlative, and when one is
there, so is the other. If you are born, you have to die; and if
you die, you have to be born. So long as there is recognition
of value in the things of the world, there will be love and
hatred for them. And so long as there is love and hatred,
desire cannot cease—it being an internal urge, and affection
for things being an external movement towards the desired
object. But nowhere does the spirit find satisfaction because
love for objects does not in any way touch the bottom of
unity. And thus, love and hatred are far removed from
reality. So births and deaths do not cease, and souls enter
different bodies in order to experience a set of karmas.
The time of death is the condition of the whole
personality when there is a cessation of willpower and
freedom of thought on the conscious level. You cannot
think as you think now, just as what may happen in deep
dream does not occur in our waking state. In the latter, by
the power of will, we deliberately suppress certain thoughts
and feelings, but in dream there is no such taboo or
restriction, and we are free to think as we like in accordance
with our deepest feelings. Thus, the last thought comes
from the whole of our being. Our deeper layers of
personality come to outer manifestation at the time of
death. Thought is deliberate thinking, while feelings
constitute the real personality of the individual.
134

Hushed thoughts, suppressed feelings are dangerous
and one has to be careful because it is these that we carry
with us at the time of death, not our relatives and wealth.
The soul repents at the time of death. The Manu Smriti
says: “When you depart, your parents, wife etc., will not
help you. You carry with you none, nothing, except the
good and bad that you have done. In the same way as you
wept when you came, you will weep when you go.” Thus, in
an unbefriended condition the soul carries its impressions,
casting off this physical body here and seeking an
atmosphere where it is possible to pay for the samskaras
and vasanas it carries with it. Violent samskaras seek
expression in the nether regions. Lower and higher realms
are not in space and time. The space and time necessary are
created by consciousness, just as when you enter into
dream, you enter a new space and time. The most
enchanting story of Lila and Padma, in the Yoga Vasistha,
shows how illusory space and time are, and how different
space-time relations can exist simultaneously. Though it
looks as if you move in them, you do not actually move.
The soul’s movement is relative even in this world, and so it
is after death, too. Birth, death and transmigration are
conditions of consciousness through which the soul passes.
yonim anye prapadyante śarīratvāya dehinaḥ,
sthāṇum anye’nusamyanti, yathā karma, yathā śrutam. (7)

“Souls which have not been liberated, enter into wombs
of different species for the sake of embodiment. According
to their deeds and thoughts, others enter stationary
objects.” We cannot say how many species there are, but
the scriptures say that the soul passes through eighty-four
lakhs of them until it becomes a human being. The soul
135

may enter into any species: a human body, or that of an
animal or anything else, as we observed. According to the
karmas it has performed and the remnant of force, it enters
into lower or higher wombs. It may seek a body in the
physical realm, or in some higher, subtler one. It may reach
the realm of svarga or that of hell. It may follow the
northern course of the sun and go to brahma-loka. It may
follow the southern course of the sun and reach pitri-loka.
It may attain jivanmukti or sadyo-mukti. Any of these
possibilities exists. As the last thought determines the
nature of the next birth, we can imagine what type of life
one has to lead if a particular thought is to be engendered at
the time of death. The last thought, determined by the
earlier ones, may be regarded as the fruit of the tree of life.
Thus, the soul can travel through various courses, enter
different wombs and species and revert again to the original
status when all karmas are exhausted. All this happens
under one condition: when our deeds are coupled with our
feelings. If we think we have done something, we will have
to reap the fruits thereof. This is why Karma Yoga is
prescribed. Our actions should not bring about a reaction
which will cause rebirth.
One's Real Self, the Same as the World-Ground
ya eṣa supteṣu jāgarti kāmam kāmam puruṣo nirmimāṇaḥ
tad eva śukraṁ tadbrahma tad evāmṛtam ucyate,
tasmin lokāḥ śritāḥ sarve, tad u nātyeti kaś cana: etad vai tat.
(8)

Here, the Upanishad shifts the emphasis to another
aspect: while the soul is reincarnated in different bodies, it
can also liberate itself, if it is honest. For this purpose, it has
136

to investigate itself deeply. Just as there is sensation behind
the awareness of objects, thinking behind ordinary
sensation, there is consciousness behind thoughts. This
consciousness is not the same as mentation; one is not the
other. Sensation is to be separated from the awareness of
objects, thought from sensation, and consciousness from
the thought.
Consciousness is not mind, mind is not sensation,
sensation is not object. Yet due to a mix-up of character,
one gets superimposed on the other. This mutual
superimposition is ananya-adhyasa, and when we
investigate it, the independence of consciousness will be
realised. This is easily done by analysing the three states of
waking, dream and deep sleep. In this mantra, a hint at it is
given: even when you are fast asleep, you may glide into the
world of dream. The various experiences you have there are
similar to the waking condition. As far as their structure is
concerned, these two states are the same.
Just as the consciousness that animates mentation, etc.,
is different from it, consciousness is different from
sensation and objects both in waking and dream. And as we
know, it exists even in deep sleep, because of which we
remember the experiences of the previous day. This shows
that consciousness stands as a witness of all states. “That
which stands ultimately separated from all phenomena—
physical,
mental, emotional—is
Brahman.
That
consciousness is the witness of the desire-filled activities in
all the states. All worlds hang on this pure Atman in His
universal nature. No one can go beyond this.
Transmigration ends here. This verily is That!” says Yama
to Nachiketas.
137

The Self is Both Immanent and Transcendent
agnir yathaiko bhuvanam praviṣṭo rῡpaṁ rῡpam prati-rῡpo
babhῡva,
ekas tathā sarva-bhῡtāntar-ātmā rῡpaṁ rῡpam prati-rῡpo
bahiś ca. (9)

This Atman is uniformly present; He is not different in
different persons and things. It is not that He is big in an
elephant, and in an ant, small. We are given three examples
here: the wind, the sun and fire. Fire burns equally, without
any partiality. It does things to all alike. It enters various
objects and burns in various hues, putting on various
contours, not on account of the difference in itself, but
because of the medium through which it passes. “As fire is
one in its original state, but when it enters the world puts
on various forms, likewise the one Atman that is uniformly
present in all bodies appears to be varied because of the
differences of bodies and intellects; and at the same time,
He exists outside.” These things named ‘men’, ‘animal’,
‘tree’ are due to the Atman’s intensity of manifestation.
When sattva predominates, we call it a genius, because in
sattva His presence is most unveiled. In the animal and
vegetable kingdoms, He is revealed in a lesser degree. And
when there is no manifestation of the Atman, it is tamas,
and so we call it a stone.
All these are His embodiments. He is uniform, One and
Absolute, even as fire is. Internally and externally He is the
same.
vāyur yathaiko bhuvanam praviṣṭo rῡpaṁ rῡpam prati-rῡpo
babhῡva,
ekas tathā sarva-bhῡtāntar-ātmā rῡpaṁ rῡpam prati-rῡpo
bahiś ca. (10)
138

He is like the air: its odour is not really its property. We
have scent at one place and smell at some other. “Just as the
quality of the air does not limit it, the quality being due to
the limitations of bodies such as room, vessel and so on;
just as the odour that we attribute to the air does not really
belong to it, so is the Atman free from any container. He is
not large or small, and also exists outside.” The properties
of the world do not belong to the Atman. He is Existence of
all beings, and being itself is His Being.”
sῡryo yathā sarva-lokasya cakṣur na lipyate cakṣuṣair bāhyadoṣaih,
ekas tathā sarva-bhῡtāntar-ātmā na lipyate loka-duḥkena
bāhyaḥ. (11)

How is the Atman unaffected? Like the sun is He
unaffected. If you spit at the sun, or praise her or abuse her,
it does not affect her. If there is jaundice in your eyes, it
does not affect her. “Just as the sun, the eye of all the world,
is not affected by external faults seen by the eyes of all
people, likewise is the Atman transcendent to the world and
is unaffected by it.” Change, increase, decrease, decay and
death are the characteristics of the world. They do not
touch the Atman. Physical and ethical characteristics,
characteristics of the senses and mind do not reach the
Atman, because He is far, far removed from the operation
of the jiva’s samsara. Without the sun we cannot live, and
yet nothing that happens to us bothers her. Even so, the
Lord does not take either of our good or bad. Though He is
immanent, He stands transcending. Far is He, internally
and externally.

139

Indescribable Bliss of Self-Realisation
eko vaśī sarva-bhῡtāntar-ātmā ekam bījam bahudhā yaḥ
karoti,
tam ātmastham ye’nupaśyanti dhīrās teṣaṁ sukhaṁ
śasvataṁ netareṣaṁ. (12)

“The One, Controller, the inner Self of all things, single,
undivided, indivisible, appears as this manifold universe, as
you may appear manifold in dream. To the wise, beholding
Him abiding in the soul, to them belongs real happiness,
and not to anyone else.” Permanent happiness belongs only
to those who have realised Him in their own being, and not
to those who run after objects.
Happiness and peace are the subjects of mantras twelve
and thirteen. To whom does happiness belong? And who is
it that can have real peace? Happiness and peace belong to
those, says the Upanishad, who are able to recognise the
Atman in His purity as the single Source of the
multitudinous variety, as the Substance of all the forms that
fill the universe. Yama is describing the unfolding of the
world with its evolutionary and involutionary activities and
its universal Centre which ramifies into the nama-rupa
prapancha, the name-and-form world. Happiness is not for
those who pursue this. All pleasures are created or brought
about by the union of senses with objects.
We have heard of the term ‘sensation’, but people rarely
understand what it means. Unfortunately for us, it is a
stimulus evoked by the repulsion taking place when senses
come into contact with objects. These experiences, falsely
taken for union, can even be brought about by the mind
contacting objects directly, without the help of the senses.
The eyes get stirred into activity in perception, and so is the
140

case with the other senses. This excitation is like the morbid
irritation which the body experiences during illness. But
when you get used to a particular sensation it becomes
normal to you, like getting accustomed to alcoholic drinks.
A person used to alcohol will not feel anything if he takes a
small quantity; this is the effect of habit. Habits become
values, significances and realities, so much so that we
become subjected to them. Instead of our controlling them,
they begin to control us.
These habits and experiences, to which we are
accustomed, constitute the world of forms which are
regarded as realities and appear as concrete objects, like the
thoughts of dream seem solid. Desires, feelings etc.,
concretise themselves into solidity, and we get real
experiences from non-existing objects. So to have a real
experience, objects are not necessary.
On the other hand, we may not experience objects, as in
sleep, and death. What is necessary is sensation, impacts on
our nerves—and not objects—though they may act as
agents. But if we can create those sensations by an inner
technique, we can have the experience also without them.
This may be seen by an example. When a mother whose
son lives abroad receives news that he is dead, she will get a
shock, though he may be alive. In this way, false messages
may depress us, or elevate us; and at the same time, real
news may not cause a sensation when they are not known.
For instance, if the boy is really dead but the mother does
not come to know it, she will be well. So whether or not
there is a corresponding fact, sensations can create
experiences.
141

When we touch a live wire, it repels us. We get an
electric shock. This happens because we came into contact
with a force having a different voltage. Likewise, our body
will burn when it touches fire, because it cannot rotate with
the fire’s force. If it could, it would not burn.
We have living magnetism in us, and when two forces
of different intensity or vibration come into contact with
each other, there is repulsion, and we call it a sensation.
Because we have five senses, the same object can create a
fivefold sensation, and from this point of view we are in a
world of things. The one form of Reality appears to be
manifold.
What we want is an experience, whether or not objects
exist, and the absence of it is the cause of our unhappiness.
But until you become the object, or the object becomes you,
there will be no oneness. One thing cannot become another
thing; otherwise, there would be only one thing. So
possession or enjoyment is an imagination; not a reality.
The whole world is drowned in sensory happiness, but
because of the fundamental defect—the impossibility of one
possessing or enjoying the other—happiness does not
belong to the objects, nor to the senses which are only
means of conveyance of stimuli. Happiness belongs to that
one Thing. Until It becomes a content of one’s experience,
there cannot be real joy. All sense-pleasures are sustained
only by the joy emanating from that one Thing. So the
senses must withdraw from all contact.
The Gita says: ye hi samsparsaja bhoga duhkhayonaya
eva te—all pleasures that are contact-born are sources of
pain. As it is false, the world will leave us one day, and so
142

only to whatever degree that diversity gives place to Unity,
there will be true happiness.
nityo’nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām eko bahῡnām yo
vidadhāti kāmān,
tam ātmastham yenupaśyanti dhīrāḥ; teṣāṁ śāntiḥ śasvatī,
netareṣāṁ. (13)

“The One eternal among the transient, the Conscious
amid the conscious, the One amid many, who grants their
desires; to them who perceive Him in the soul, is eternal
peace.” Peace cannot be had as long as you do not know the
way. Silence or peace is not absence of outward noise or
tumult; even if all people keep silent, there cannot be real
peace, for there will be a burning within. Peace is another
name for happiness. It is not a dead substance; it is vitality.
It is not sleep. It is attended by consciousness; then only has
it meaning. If you are a wealthy man but not aware of it, the
fact has no meaning for you. It is awareness that gives
meaning to life. Maya is nothing but the net spread out by
the senses who deceive us. Under such circumstances, there
cannot be peace.
Peace is the nature of the Atman , as bliss is. The more
you manifest Him in your life, the more you become
blissful, powerful: your face glows with radiance. Not only
have you peace within, but you can also radiate it outward,
like the sun. “The One eternal among the transient, the
Conscious amid the conscious, the One amid many, who
grants their desires; to them who perceive Him in the soul,
is eternal peace.” He is eternal among the so-called
permanent things of the world, which are the temporarily
permanent; not the eternally permanent. A building is
permanent, but not eternal. While the objects of the world
143

can be called permanent, they are not eternal; but within
them is a permanent substance, the Atman .
Intelligence is immanent in the human beings, in
animals, in the vegetable kingdom. In the subtler realms,
like svarga etc., we are in a spiritual world, not in an
intellectual one, like ours. We are closer to reality there, and
the senses become more and more ethereal and less and less
useful, so that when we reach the highest, brahma-loka, we
do not need the senses at all, and one mixes with the other,
one mirrors the other, and so the world of senses is
transcended by purified intelligence.
Even heavenly satisfactions of the world are only forms
of that one supreme Satisfaction. The ocean can be diverted
through various channels, and it can run through them
with greater or lesser intensity, but the content of water is
the same, irrespective of its force in the various outlets. So
is the Atman in the same intensity in all beings. If a mirror
is clean, it will reflect well. If it is painted with tar or any
other colour, it will reflect accordingly. Higher forms of life
reveal greater and greater manifestations of the Atman,
until we come to the human level and even higher ones.
When the creeper moves towards the light of the sun, it is
seeking the Atman in its own blind manner. When the trees
strike their roots deep inside the earth, it is for His sake.
When birds fly hither and thither in search of food, when
animals graze in the field, they are seeking the Atman.
When we, human beings, work hard, it is not for any other
reason but for that Atman which we have not yet found.
We have been creeping like plants, grazing like animals;
and we have not found Him—by these means He is not to
be found. These variegated forms are His great drama; but
144

we are involved in it, and so we don’t enjoy it. Enjoyment is
for the spectator, not for the dramatis personae. Such is the
degeneration into which consciousness has distended.
The one Experience of the Atman appears to have taken
the manifold forms of this world. Suppose our different
limbs became self-conscious, what would our condition be?
They would fight among themselves. War taking place in
one’s own body is insanity. The wars in the world are only a
kind of insanity, a tension between forms which are of a
single Being.
‘My dear ones, children of immortality, never can you
find peace in this world which is torn asunder’, says Yama.
‘Peace is to those who recognise the one Atman as present
in their own self, as the supreme Enjoyer, and not as the
object of enjoyment.’ ‘Know the Knower, see the Seer,
understand the Understander’, say the Upanishads. Who is
to understand the Understander? There is a strange way of
knowing the Knower.
It is called atmasakshatkara or Self-realisation. To them
who have attained belongs real peace.
tad etad iti manyante’ nirdeśyam paramaṁ sukham,
kathaṁ nu tad vijānīyām kimu bhāti vibhāti vā. (14)

How are we to designate the Atman as this or that when
He is in all things? Mystics have called Him ‘That which Is’.
“This is that; indescribable supreme Bliss is that Supreme
Being.” It cannot be indicated by any symbol. It is
anirdeshya. Nachiketas wants to know: katham nu tad
vijaniyam...”Does He shine from within or from without? Is
He within or without, this wonderful Atman? Does He
shine by Himself, or does He shine in reflection?” And
Yama answers:
145

The Self-Luminous Light of the World
na tatra sῡryo bhāti na candra-tārakam, nemā vidyuto
bhānti, kuto’yam agniḥ;
tameva bhāntam anubhāti sarvaṁ tasya bhāsā sarvam idaṁ
vibhāti. (15)

“The sun shines not there, not the moon and the stars:
if millions of suns were to shine they would not be equal to
That whose shining illumines every light.” Which light can
illumine It? We breathe because of the breath of That
Breathless Being. We exist because of That Supreme
Existence; all things depend on That—how could they
derive vitality from anything else! In that supreme Life, this
so-called sun of empirical life, this moon or mind, this fire
of human desire, do not shine; all these are mockeries
before the Atman. Our intellect, even that of a genius, all
that we regard as the highest in us, are matchless before
Him. All values are borrowed from That Supreme Value,
and there remains nothing, when they are returned to It.
The empirical values and realities of the world are
reflections of the paramarthika-satta, or Eternal Reality.
These
three,
pratibhasika,
vyavaharika
and
paramarthika, are but three expressions of the One. Just as
light can pass through a clear, coloured or broken glass and
get reflected accordingly, the one Reality can reveal Itself in
different ways. All these manifestations: matter, body,
mind; earth, water, fire, air, ether etc., are rays, varying in
intensity, of the same Light from which all lights come. This
is the joy which sustains us. That is the ocean of ambrosia
which is not lifeless nectar of the celestials, but a conscious
one. This mantra is a description of the satchidananda
Atman.
146

SECTION 3 – THE TREE OF LIFE
The World-tree Rooted in Brahman
ῡrdhva-mῡlo’vāk-śākha eṣo’śvatthas sanātanaḥ,
tad eva śukraṁ tad brahma, tad evāmṛtam ucyate,
tasmin lokāḥ śritāḥ sarve tad u nātyeti kaś cana: etad vai tat.
(1)

“This is that eternal Ashvattha Tree with roots above
and branches below. That indeed is the pure. That is
Brahman. That alone is the immortal. In It, all worlds are
contained, and none goes beyond. This, verily, is That.” The
third section, the concluding one of this Upanishad,
commences with a unique comparison, the same which we
find in the fifteenth chapter of the Gita. While the words of
the Gita differ slightly from those of this mantra, the idea is
the same: it is the description of the famous Tree of Life.
The analogy of this tree is not peculiar to our scriptures
alone. The tale of this tree can also be found in the mystical
texts of other cultures, though descriptions may differ
slightly; but they all symbolise life.
While trees usually have their roots growing
downwards, this tree has them growing upwards. Why so?
Why should it be unlike other trees? There is a spiritual
significance in this. Just as a tree has an origin, life has an
origin. As the tree goes through the process of growth and
evolution, so does life. As the tree is sustained by certain
elements, life also is sustained. As the tree has many
branches, life is manifold too. As the tree sprouts forth into
flowers and fruits, life does similarly. As the tree is
exuberant in certain seasons, so is life. As the tree can be
felled, life can be cut. As the tree falls, life also ends. The
147

process of living can be compared to the growth of the tree.
The reason why its roots strike upwards is the process of
life itself.
The manifestation of the universe can be seen in two
ways: it is not clear whether God created it instantaneously,
by an act of Will, or whether it evolves, rising from one
stage to another. The Bible says that God willed, and the
universe came into existence. But the view of the scientists
does not agree with this doctrine of yugapat-srishti; they
hold that it has evolved. Vedanta accepts both theories.
Even if creation is yugapat, this does not exclude the idea of
evolution. The fact that time and space belong to creation
does not necessarily suggest that it need be in space and
time. In this timeless causation which is difficult for the
mind to understand, the process of world evolution is
super- intellectual. Ishvara creates in a mysterious manner,
not in the logical way we think of. If His sudden Will were
the cause of creation, it might be called whimsical. He
would be accused of having made some people good and
some bad. But, according to the Gita, God has no fancy. He
takes the karmas of the jivas into consideration. Many trees
grow on this earth: somewhere mango trees; somewhere
thorns; various kinds in various places. The earth will bring
forth whatever you sow, and sustain it, whether it is a tree
with sweet fruit or a tree with bitter fruit. Likewise do the
sun, the river, etc.; they shed light or give water to all in the
same manner. Nature is absolutely impartial. So is God, the
general Sustainer; He is supreme Impartiality, sustaining
both the wicked and the virtuous. “The seeds are there,”
says Shankaracharaya. Seeds represent those jivas who have
148

been wound up in the previous cycle and who lie in deep
sleep, as it were.
For example, we all go to sleep. A king sleeps, a beggar
sleeps, a lawyer sleeps, and so on. We may say that in the
state of deep sleep, we are all the same in one sense. The
differences arise only when the ego sprouts. When it is
hushed down in sleep, there is equality. In brahma-loka, the
Cosmic Sleep into which all jivas are withdrawn at the end
of a cycle, when Brahma, or hiranyagarbha, withdraws His
personality, they do not get liberated, but lie wound up,
ready for germination in the next kalpa. Just as sleep is not
samadhi, the being wound up after a kalpa is not liberation.
When Brahma wakes up into consciousness in the next
cycle, the jivas shoot forth, and as we awake, being what we
were yesterday, after our nightly sleep, so do they wake up
to work out their karmas. The manner of working them out
may vary slightly from kalpa to kalpa, but the method or
pattern is the same. And so, at every pralaya or cyclic
dissolution, the seeds of jivas are in the tree of life. They are
there; they are not created.
Since when do they exist? This question cannot arise.
Time is also a part of creation; it is from eternity to eternity.
To every kalpa there is an earlier one, just as we cannot say
whether the tree came first, or the seed.
The tree described here refers to a span of life. It has its
roots above in Brahma, or hiranyagarbha. The Sankhya tells
us that the world has evolved from mulaprakriti. If the seed
is prakriti, the trunk is constituted of mahat and ahamkara.
It has no branches; they shoot forth later on. It is sustained
by the root of prakriti, the impartial light of the purusha.
The branches ramify from the trunk. Two huge branches
149

shoot forth from ahankara-tattva. These are the
macrocosm and the microcosm, the brahmanda and the
pindanda, we may say; a huge and a small branch, but both
are sustained by the same trunk. On one side we have the
tanmatras which mix to form the five elements, and the
mahabhutas. On the other side, there are the psychological
organs such as the mind, intellect, etc., in the individual.
Then come the ten senses, the five pranas, the subsidiary
pranas, the physical body; all intimately related to the
brahmanda, constituted of the same stuff, all organically
connected to the trunk. The psychological organs, senses,
etc., have their loves and hatred, the tendency to virtue and
vice, all the strong and weak points of human nature; the
urge to evolution and involution, for sense-gratification
and God-realisation.
The sap of the tree permeates each cell. Having its
branches in the form of the elements, the mahabhutas, the
sense-organs, it spreads out and downward, right from
brahma-loka through the seven worlds above to this gross
earth and the seven worlds below. This tree is sustained by
the universal purusha or Brahman; it is permanent in one
sense, and impermanent in another one. It is shashvata—it
cannot be destroyed. It runs from eternity to eternity. The
karmas of the jivas are the ultimate cause of it, and they are
endless. But it is really not constituted of any eternal
element. Neither this world nor this body can be said to be
permanent.
The world and body, the panorama of creation, present
before our senses a picture of permanency on account of
the speed with which they rotate. If our eyes could rotate
with the speed of the body’s electrons which form the
150

bricks of the world, we could see them, and there would be
no world to behold. They move fast and our eyes move
slow, and hence there is perception of forms. There is
destruction of body cells, a change in the position of
electrons, and nothing remains steady. Like the flowing
water of a river: when you touch it for a second, it is not the
same as you touched earlier. Likewise, when you touch an
object twice, you are not touching the same object. The
flame of a lamp appears to be steady, but there is constant
flow and you do not see the same flame a second time.
The world is constituted of such unsteady elements, and
so it is said to be ashvatha, that which will not last till
tomorrow; and yet it appears as permanent, shashvata. This
so-called tree of samsara has its roots struck in prakriti
constituted of sattva, rajas and tamas, but it is ultimately
made up of one substance, whatever be the variety of this
vast creation. The absolutely pure Brahman is the Source of
it, and also its Sustainer and Withdrawer. From This,
everything starts, and into This everything returns. Many
examples are given to illustrate this point. Like the spider
and its web, so is creation. The web is part of the matter of
the spider’s body, but it appears as outside it. Or like the
flashing forth of sparks of fire. This life-tree has its roots in
Brahman. Even prakriti is in Brahman.
Ultimately, all is reducible to one substance:
Consciousness. And into This, all creation gravitates. All
beings are strung upon this Being. Every thing is connected
to It, inseparably—even the distant stars and the high
heavens. All things in all degrees of subtlety are connected
to It; nothing is beyond the purusha, was said in an earlier
verse.
151

“What is it that remains in the end of all things?” was
Nachiketas’ question. “This is That,” is Yama’s answer.
The Great Fear
yad idaṁ kiñ ca jagat sarvam prāṇa ejati niḥsṛtam,
mahad bhayaṁ vajram udyatam, ya etad vidur amṛtās te
bhavanti. (2)

All things are strung on this Being, but not in a
mechanical manner. The thread has no control over the
beads, though they hang on it. But here, the relation is quite
different. It is one of inseparability and organic connection:
without the cause, there is no effect. Some say the relation
between God and the world is like between an earthen pot
and the earth of which it is a form. But others feel that it
does not explain the whole situation. God is not merely the
material; He also fashions it. He is the effective as well as
the instrumental cause simultaneously. As ishvara—the
universal Intelligence—He becomes the efficient cause, but
as sattva, rajas and tamas—as what the Sankhya calls
prakriti—He becomes the material one; the avarana-shakti
and vikshepa-shakti, as the Vedanta puts it.
His control over creation is absolute, it is not
conditional. Whatever the threads do, that happens to the
cloth. If the threads extend, the cloth also expands. If the
threads contract, so does the cloth. Whatever the thread’s
colour, that is the cloth’s also. If there is no thread, there is
no cloth. The expansion of God is the expansion of the
world, because His will and the object—the world—are the
same. They are not different like our will and objects. He
works from within, not like a carpenter who is outside the
object on which he works. We cannot imagine what this
152

combined material, instrumental and efficient causality of
God is. Nothing can shake or move or be without His Will.
This supreme hiranyagarbha, the sutratman, is the ultimate
Controller of this vast puppet show of the cosmos. As He
manipulates through His Will, so acts the universe. He is
the mahaprana, the cosmic breath, and nothing can exist
without Him; even the direction in which a leaf moves is
determined by His Will: “The whole universe—whatever
exists— vibrates because it has sprung from Brahman. It is
a great terror, like the poised thunderbolt. Those who know
It become immortal.” Great fear is God. Everything is afraid
of this Supreme Will of ishvara. No one can go against it.
Those who had the hardihood of disobeying are getting
roasted in samsara, and yet He attracts everything back to
Himself again.
The Satan of the Bible is a symbol for the original
deviation of individual consciousness from ishvara’s will.
The boons that God bestows on you, as well as the
punishment He inflicts, are indescribable. The ocean of
completeness, that is ishvara-sankalpa. It can sweep off
everything, or absorb everything into Itself. It is like the
vajra of Indra: a terror, an uplifted thunderbolt against
everyone. Yet, people go against it and run after senseobjects, and thus are caught in the widespread net of death.
It is compared to supreme fear because, like the parts of a
machine that cannot deviate to an extra activity of their
own, there is no freedom of going beyond ishvara-sankalpa.
Freedom is not independence asserted over His Will. It is
freedom to move within that. Our idea of freedom is to do
whatever we like. It is not freedom, but license. The more
we are away from ishvara-sankalpa, the more are we
153

bound. The nearer we are to it, the freer we become.
Human freedom is only a partial manifestation of His will
in us. Even our apparent freedom is allowed by ishvara, and
because of His sankalpa, we exist.
The moment you know this, you become free, because
to know is to be. To know the existence of God as the
material, instrumental and efficient causes in one’s own
being is to rise at once to the state of immortality.
Thought moves things better than the limbs of the
body. A powerful thought is capable of working great
miracles, because of its capacity to permeate things more
thoroughly than bodies coming into contact with external
objects. Thus your thought, your attitude and volition have
greater command. God being the greatest of these
psychological forces, He can execute not merely by
thought—thinking being too inadequate for Him—but by
His mere being or existence, just as the sun, which moves
not, can determine the movement of the orbit of other
planets. Every star, every planet, every thing seems to have
a prescribed way of motion. All are being controlled by a
power which need not be visible. So does the whole cosmos
act in all levels. This is the true meaning of the verse in the
Bhagavadgita: ishvarah sarvabhutanam hrideshe’arjuna
tishthati—God seated in all hearts works in a miraculous
manner, without rest. His Existence is so interconnected
with that of all else in creation that by His asserting it, all
things are determined. This is what is meant by saying that
fear is driven into the hearts of everything like a
thunderbolt: no one can move out of the orbit of God’s will.
Birth and death are only a fraction of this miraculous
will, because these two ends of the chain of development
154

are not two distinct, unconnected elements in our life. They
are means evolving to an end which need not be known to
those involved. The entire process of the tree’s unfolding,
from the seed to a small plant, a tree, into flowers, into
fruits, to a condition of withering—everything is
determined by the seed’s constitution. Similarly, the
momentum hidden in space rockets, which is known only
to the scientists, allows them the time to reach their
destination, to return, etc. All this is contained in the
mechanism’s hidden force.
When a thing is born, it is released with a momentum
for working matters out. The force latent in the sperm and
ovum, before the birth of the child, is a potential form, and
the length of time from its revelation upto its death is
determined in it. Birth, therefore, determines death. It is
not an unconnected event taking place in a life. It is an
organic link of the jiva’s existence. Likewise, too, is the
peculiar determination of things, one being connected to
another, and one life not getting merely extinct, but
continuing after death. We may be reborn in any realm,
and such birth would be impossible if some sort of relation
were not already established between the soul and the realm
into which it enters. The physical and astral worlds, organic
and inert bodies—everything in all realms is determined by
one single Will called ishvara-sankalpa.
bhayād asyāgnis tapati, bhayāt tapati sῡryaḥ,
bhayād indraś ca vāyuś ca, mṛtyur dhāvati pañcamaḥ. (3)

“From fear of It, fire burns, the sun shines; through fear
of It, Indra, the wind and Death, the fifth, speed on their
way.” The shining of the sun, the pouring of rains, the
blowing of the wind, the changing of seasons—all these are
155

determined by this single Law; and the scriptures say that
no complaints should be made against rain or wind or heat,
because they are divine. This illustrates that God is present
in everything. He dwells in all natural processes, and we can
worship Him through them. In all these manifestations,
God is to be seen in the river that flows, in the sun that
shines, in the trees that grow, in the birds that chirp, in the
moral laws within us. Knowing this, one becomes
immortal.
Degrees of Perception of the Self
iha ced aśakad boddhum prāk śarīrasya visrasaḥ,
tataḥ sargeṣu lokeṣu śarīratvāya kalpate. (4)

This is a highly controversial mantra, because the
translation as it is seems to be incorrect. Shankara adds
some words to give it a proper meaning, while Madhava
changes the word ‘sarge’ into ‘svarge’.
Literally and grammatically translated it reads: “If a
person is in a position to know this before casting off his
body, he becomes fit for rebirth in some world.” This way,
the latter part contradicts the earlier one, and because it
does not make sense, Shankara says: “If one is not in a
position to know... .” Max Mueller agrees in his translation.
This is a possible meaning, but not suggested by the words.
Other interpreters translate with: “If one has the strength to
realise this truth before the shedding of this body, he
becomes endowed with the power to enter into everything
in the universe.” This seems to be correct, because it is
corroborated through a mantra of the Chhandogya
Upanishad which says that if one realises God he has free
access to everything and nobody can restrict him. His
156

freedom is unlimited like that of the gods, if only he reaches
the goal before he sheds this body.
So, if we compare the three meanings; Shankara: “If one
can realise this truth before he sheds this body, then, of
course, he is not reborn.” Madhava: “If you cannot realise
this truth before the shedding of this body, you will be
reborn in such realms as heaven.” And lastly: “If one
realises this truth before shedding this body, he becomes
possessed of such power that he enters into everything.”
This agrees with the BrhadaranyakaUpanishad, too: “A
person who knows the Truth, he knows the world and the
world is his.”
yathādarśe tathātmani, yathā svapne tathā pitṛ-loke,
yathāpsu parīva dadṛśe, tathā gandharva-loka chāyā-tapayor
iva brahma-loke. (5)

“As in a mirror, so in the intellect; as in a dream, so in
the World of the Fathers; as in water, so in the World of the
gandharvas; and as in light and shade in the World of
Brahma.” This mantra illustrates the experiences of souls in
the different realms of creation. What is your experience in
this world? What is your experience in the world of the
forefathers, in the world of the gandharvas, and in brahmaloka? They differ greatly, says the Upanishad. Here, in this
world of mortals, we are not able to see the distinction
between the Atman and objects, including our own body.
They seem to be mingled. The latter one is superimposed
on the former, and this super-imposition is brought about
mutually by subject and object. You see your Self in the
object, and that is why you love it.
As a face reflected in a mirror is not the original, so
does the subject project its own psychic impurities onto the
157

object and creates a tension of love and hatred between
them. One does not become the other. One cannot become
the other. But the characteristics of one get transferred to
the other so much that you do not know which is the
subject and which the object. Thus, in our world, there is a
mix-up of the Seerand the seen. This is samsara. You are
mentally connected with so many things. This psychic
connection has to be snapped. When the mirror is clean,
you see the Atman. But this is not so easy, because you have
become one with the object, and when you see the object
instead of the Atman, there is ignorance and aviveka; there
are raga-dvesha, attachment and suffering.
In pitri-loka, consciousness is only involved as in
dream. There, the souls have a hazy notion of the Reality
behind subject and object, just as when we wake up, we
know that the dream selves and objects were not real. So
there are occasional breaks on that level of consciousness,
and an awakening into the nature of the Atman.
In the world of the gandharvas, the Atman is visible in
the same way as our body is seen reflected through shaky
water. The object and subject are not so egoistically
involved with each other as to cause attraction and
repulsion. Therefore, awakening is more easily possible
than in other realms, the transiency of experience being
indicated by the symbol of the shaky water surface. And so
now and then they awaken to the consciousness of the
Atman, though they are also subject to attraction and
repulsion because these are present everywhere, though in
higher realms to lesser degrees.
In brahma-loka, there is a clear-cut distinction between
the divine light of the Self and the darkness of objects, just
158

as light is seen different from shadow, because souls stand
free from sensations and desires. While there is objective
experience even there, Brahma sees Himself in creation
clearly, devoid of the darkness of superimpositions.
The perception of objects in this world is a play of
colours. By manipulating light and shade, objects can be
perceived differently. It is colour that gives perceptibility to
them, and how they really are can never be seen, because
the moment you put light on them, they change. Likewise,
our mental light colours them according to our own
psyche, and this is jiva-srishti. The existence of an object,
light, a particular distance, a particular mental condition,
senses, emotional relation—all are necessary to create a
perceptional process. But in brahma-loka, things are as they
are in themselves.
In ordinary perception, there is a mixing-up of shabda,
artha and jnana, says Patanjali. The utterance of a name
creates a sensation and produces an idea and a picture in
the mind. Therefore, we do not perceive the objects as they
are in themselves, but the idea we have of them. But
spiritual intuition is independent of all these. In brahmaloka, we do not need the mind in order to perceive. The
Spirit beholds in a peculiar manner which is all luminosity.
There, the anandamaya-kosha functions, and the psychical
body which we need in this world is not necessary.
There are infinite degrees of difference between subject
and object. The instances described here are only a few. We
can have as many types of experiences as there can be
numbers of worlds. The Yoga Vasishtha goes into great
details of all this. In some worlds, all material is made of
gold; in others, of copper. Some are filled with trees or
159

reptiles. There is an infinite variety in this creation of God.
The highest perception, all luminous and free of
particularisation, is Brahma’s. For this, we have to purify
ourselves of all mental and psychic layers. We must be able
to withdraw in the manner prescribed in the earlier
mantras: by pranayama, by not getting attached to things,
by standing as a witness. The process is described in mantra
six.
The Gradation Up To the Cosmic Being
indriyāṇām pṛthag-bhāvam udayāstamayau ca yat,
pṛthag utpadyamānānam matvā dhīro na śocati. (6)

“The indriyas are different from the Self; their rise and
fall belongs to them alone, thus, the wise man does not
grieve.” These ideas have already been expressed earlier.
The instruction is that our senses should be controlled. All
our difficulties are of the senses, brought about by their
mischievous unintelligibility. It is like employing an
untrained, devious servant. But worse even, they are
impetuous, often compared to bulls, mad horses etc. In the
beginning, a wild bull will rise against the one who tries to
tame it. There is a series of very interesting pictures on this
in Tibetan literature. The bull can be brought round by
various means: sometimes with a cajolery, sometimes by a
threat, etc., but there is always the danger or the threat to
the life of the tamer himself. Similarly, if the sadhaka is not
careful in his way of self-control, or if he resorts to wrong
practices, there is a chance of his suffering aberration. He
may even bring about his own destruction. It is thus very
difficult to control the senses. They cannot be controlled by
force, because they, too, have force, and force meeting force
160

is not a safe method. One brahmastra meeting another
brahmastra brought about great destruction in the
Mahabharata war.
So it is necessary to approach the senses carefully.
Sama, dana, bheda and danda methods are necessary.
When you act like a friend, with great understanding, you
use sama. Dana is the second method. You cannot starve
them forever; so you have to give them a little something at
times so that they get not too bewildered, but you cannot
agree with everything they want. Then there is the third
method of bheda: the mind must be told and made to
understand, ‘if you control yourself, you will get the joy of
Brahman’, because it is foolish and it thinks it is being
tormented for nothing, and so it does not go to yoga with
joy. But when it is told through svadhyaya, satsanga etc.,
that there is a great goal awaiting it, that if it undergoes a
little pain it will get a vast treasure, it will understand.
Sometimes, you have to starve the mind by vak-danda,
mano-danda and kaya-danda. The punishment of speech is
not to utter any word, and the punishment of the body is
not to give any food to it. The punishment of the mind is
concentration, ekagrata, to think of one thing only. If the
mind thinks of a second thing, shout that second thing
loudly so that it will be prevented from going after it.
“Don’t be friendly with the senses,” says this mantra.
“They are not your friends, and you have nothing in
common. They try to run outward, while you want to go
within. They tell you that there are many things, while you
seek the One Thing.”
The five senses give us five types of reports. These are
consolidated by a single consciousness, and the knower of
161

them is not the senses. They are inert, they belong to
prakriti; and chaitanya is of the purusha. The senses rise
and fall at the bid of consciousness that brought them forth,
and the knowledge which they try to give is not theirs. You
have to bring it together. The eyes can only report colour,
the ears, sound etc., and yet you seem to think that there is
one unified experience. What is the secret? The secret is the
intelligence, and so you should resort to that.
indriyebhyaḥ param mano manasaṣ sattvam uttamam,
sattvād adhi mahān ātmā, mahato’vyaktam uttamam. (7)

Why do you go to the senses as if they were everything?
“The mind is superior to, and controls the, senses. The
intelligence controls the mind; superior to the intellect is
the mahat-tattva beyond which is mulaprakriti, of which
hiranyagarbha is the manifestation. Beyond everything is
the purusha.” Why don’t you go to the Supreme Being?
Why to the senses which are the lowest manifestation? This
purusha is all-pervading, and nothing is greater than He.
avyaktāt tu paraḥ puruso vyāpako’liṅga eva ca,
yaṁ jñātvā mucyate jantur amṛtatvaṁ ca gacchati. (8)

Unfortunately for us, we cannot define this purusha.
The mind and the senses can be defined; hiranyagarbha
and virat can be symbolically explained, but not the
purusha. We cannot define anything without reference to
its qualities and attributes, but He is devoid of these, and
He is therefore undefinable. “He is alinga—but if you have
the blessedness to realise Him by some means or other,
titiksha is attained.” The purusha without any mark cannot
be meditated upon. So different Upanishads give us
definitions and qualities of Him to be meditated on, like
162

satyam, jnanam, anantam, vijnanam, tat tvam asi, etad vai
tat, etc. These are symbols; not definitions of God. There
are various symbols, including the idols in temples. Any
one will do, provided it is taken as the final one. By this, the
purusha can be realised.
na saṁdṛśe tiṣṭhati rῡpam asya, na cakṣuṣā paśyati
kaścanainam,
hṛdā maṇīṣā manasābhikḷpto ya etad vidur amṛtās te
bhavanti. (9)

“With open eyes this great Being cannot be seen;
nobody has seen Him with his eyes. He has to be felt in the
heart. Those who know Him in this manner, they become
realised.” He is not seen by the senses, but felt in the mind
as sattva. The senses cannot give us this feeling; they are too
dissipated. So try to meditate in the deepest recesses of your
heart. This meditation is yoga.
The Method of Yoga
yadā pañcāvatiṣṭhante jñānāni manasā saha,
buddhiś ca na viceṣṭati, tām āhuḥ paramāṃ gatim. (10)

Yoga is meditation, finally, and every other technique is
an accessory to it. What is meditation? It is a joint activity
of the senses, mind and intellect. Three conditions are
stated: “When the five senses stand together with the mind,
the mind is still and the intellect is also still—which means
to say that the senses, the mind and intellect should come
together—that state is yoga, the highest state.” A steady
repose of the senses is yoga; steadfastness of the senses is
yoga. This is a simple definition. It may appear to be
simple, but one should be very careful here because you
163

may be in yoga or you may not be in yoga. You may fall if
your balance is not maintained.
The five senses are to stand together with the mind and
intellect, because generally they do not. The mind and
senses work independently though the mind depends on
them. It is like the photographic film which receives the
impressions from outside. The function of the intellect is to
judge. It does not directly move to the objects. It judges
them through the mind in terms of the reports given by the
senses. The objects are in immediate proximity to them,
and remotely connected to the mind and intellect. But an
experience and judgment is so rapid that all these processes
take place almost simultaneously. For instance, when the
eyes see a snake on the road, the report is given to the mind
and at once the intellect not merely judges, but also gives
orders to the prana, and you run away.
But in yoga these different activities are integrated,
brought together for a single purpose. All five senses should
be engaged in the same activity. In Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra,
pratyahara is defined as non-difference of the sense-power
from the mental-power. It is like the prodigal son coming
back home. In meditation or yoga, the senses who, in daily
life, have never been one with the mind, come back, having
realised the futility of wandering in the world. They have
nothing more to do with it. You open your eyes and look
because you want information from outside, but they do
not want anything now. They feel they had enough and
they return to their source. Thus, when they come, it is like
a river entering an ocean—the mind gets flooded with all
the energy you have wasted in sensation; in seeing, hearing,
tasting etc. This conserved energy of pratyahara has a
164

tremendous power, and here, whatever you think takes
place. If you say anything, it happens immediately.
When the senses come together with the mind, the
work of the intellect is reduced. Before, it had to pass
different judgments because of the variegated activities of
the senses, but now it has only one judgement to pass. The
whole universe stands as a single object, and if you know it,
you know all objects. When the senses, mind and intellect
stand together, there is a fusion of forces. This is called the
union of shakti and shakta: all the powers of the mind and
intellect merge into the intelligence.
More, you enter the highest form of meditation where a
steady flame of consciousness is burning, selfconsciousness in the universal sense. The Seerresting in
himself is called kaivalya-mukti. When the Seer is busy
shedding light on the intellect, the intellect busy in judging
the report of the senses presented by the mind and when
the senses are busy with the objects, it is not yoga. But when
the senses have ceased from their function and return to the
mind and the mind stands with the intellect, and the
intellect merges itself into the Seer, it is yoga.
tām yogam iti manyante sthirām indriya-dhāraṇām
apramattas tadā bhavati, yogo hi prabhavāpyayau. (11)

“The steady control of the senses is yoga.” Don’t worry
about the mind. Control the senses. That is yoga. But the
senses are not the organs of perception. They are called
jnanendriyas, senses of knowledge. So in every activity of
sensation, there is a type of knowledge involved: the cars,
trees, etc., are not the senses, and they are not to be
controlled. The senses are the different types of sensation;
an understanding, knowledge, consciousness or
165

appreciation in respect of the world outside. Looking is
mere indeterminate perception, which is harmless. But
seeing is appreciation of values. This is called bondage; this
is jiva-srishti. Mere sensation in an indeterminate, general
psychological sense is not what binds. Selfish concern it is
that binds. Do you have such an interest in a thing? Then
you should be careful.
You may see or touch an object without being attached
to it, because sensation not related to emotion is different
from emotional sensation. You feel a joy in touching a
thing; by seeing a thing, you are either pleased or
displeased. But by looking at something, if there is no such
emotional reaction, you will not be bound. So tying a piece
of cloth over the mouth and such other austerities is not
control. If there is a steadfastness of the internal senses, it is
yoga.
In short: ishvara-drishti, or the sight of God, is to be
developed in yoga. He also sees, but the way in which He
sees is different from our way. His perception is yoga and
ours is bhoga. We are to develop God’s vision towards
things and not a personal attitude. I-ness and mine-ness
have to be given up. Try to develop ishvara-drishti for one
day and see what a difference it makes. When you practice
it, you will see how difficult it is! Vigilance is necessary,
because the senses will din on you again and again—that
there are many objects, that they are desirable or
undesirable, etc. So be vigilant!
You cannot be in yoga always. Be careful. “Just because
you concentrated well one day does not mean that you have
risen to the highest. Yoga comes and goes.” Never think
you are well-off in yoga. Spiritual pride is the worst thing.
166

No one should have the hardihood to say that he has
achieved the pinnacle of yoga. Great people are always
humble. Swami Sivananda used to say: “I try to be good; I
do not know anything more.” Studying the life of yogins, we
should learn to be careful on the path. Unless one becomes
cautious at all times there might be a fall which will bring
him to the lowest state. The repetition of mantras ten and
eleven is therefore very beneficial.
The Self is Existence
naiva vācā na manasā prāptuṁ śakyo na cakṣuṣā,
astīti bruvato’nyatra kathaṁ tad upalabhyate. (12)

“What it is that you will achieve in yoga is difficult to
say. Neither words nor things can explain Him. The mind
cannot in its farthest imagination touch the fringe of Him.
How can you speak of Him except to accept that He is what
He is.” Don’t try to understand; you will know Him when
you reach Him.
The concept of Reality is the subject of mantras twelve
and thirteen. It has often been held that Reality cannot be
conceived of; it is beyond thought. And in such ancient
scriptures as the Rig Veda we have a famous negative
definition of Reality in the Nasadiya Sukta: “It could not be
said that there was something or that there was nothing;
such was what was before the origin of the universe.” And it
ends with: “Who could say what was, because who was
there to say?”
The difficulty lies in it being the Absolute while all
definitions are relative. No description is possible without
relations, and inasmuch as the Absolute Truth is nonrelational, there is nothing with which it can be compared.
167

It is on this account that the Mandukya Upanishad defines
it as: “nantah prajnam, na bahih prajnam...” It is not light,
not darkness, not above, not below... These are the ways in
which we are lead to the neti-neti doctrine in the
Brihadanyaka Upanishad: if you are to say something about
Reality, you have to say what it is not. That the human
mind is cornered in its attempt to know Truth does not
solve the problem, because what one needs is not a negation
of form merely, but a realisation of the Essence. Negative
definitions might satisfy the logical mind, but not the
aspiration of the seeking soul. The heart is pleased and the
intellect convinced by a positive thing.
A peculiar urge in the human being leaves it dissatisfied
in spite of the logical conclusion that only negative
definitions are possible. There is no pleasure in any kind of
negativity. This was observed in the Chhandogya
Upanishad, where Maharishi Uddalaka says that if you
negate everything, you end in a large non-being. Everything
that seems to be existent has to be traced to the universal
Being. So the difficulty lies in the fact that when the reason
for the intellect’s resort to negative definition is forgotten,
only a void is reached. It is not that we seek negativity. We
have been forced by a logical necessity, in order to conceive
Reality, but what we get is not Reality, but a logical
conclusion. This negative definition found its apotheosis in
the shunya-vada of Buddhism, the negation of all positive
values, including that of existence; swallowing everything
the mind can conceive of, leaving nothing positive. Maybe
this is why Uddalaka makes an affirmation: “My dear child,
the original Reality should be regarded as being, and not
non-being.” While there is the danger of emptiness or
168

pessimism when postulating a negative definition of
Reality, there is another danger in affirming a Being of
which we have no knowledge. Even the Buddha said that to
say nothing is one extreme, and to say everything is another
extreme, because truth lies in the middle.
The Kathopanishad, too, takes up the concept of the
Supreme Reality in practical realisation. Some psychologists
and gurus believe that one should not think in meditation.
This idea does not seem to be correct. I happened to have
an interesting talk with some ardent followers of this
dogma.
“‘If you feel nothing and think nothing, what is your
experience?” was my question. They said that there is no
experience, because even experience is a thought which is
to be set aside. This is also a negative attitude, and not a
positive one of realisation. One of the tests of success in
meditation is that you return from it with a sort of great
satisfaction or delight. It is not that you enter a lion’s den
where you find nothing. Meditation is a contact with
Reality, though it may be the farthest fringe of It.
So in all our discussions of truth, we should not be
satisfied merely with grammatical explanations or verbal
definitions, but attempt to have a practical experience.
Is Reality positive or negative, is a crucial question. If
you negate everything, if you deny Brahman, then you deny
yourself, because Brahman is only another name for your
own Reality. But in your effort to think of Reality, what
attitude are you to adopt? In mantra twelve, the
Kathopanishad says that no attempt is going to succeed
easily. You cannot think It with your mind. How then can
you have an idea about It? You cannot see It with your eyes,
169

nor explain Its characteristics. Mind, speech and all senses
return baffled when they attempt to know Reality.
“Nevertheless,” says Yama, “finally I might say that you
should regard it as ‘being’, because what else could be said
about It?” So being seems to be the attitude recommended
here. Brahman is not the negation of all things, because
even if It is that, It implies the existence of something: the
final remainder, pursued through the process of neti-neti, is
Reality. The doctrine of negation also implies your own self.
What then remains? Not nothing, because that which has
denied or set aside everything, that which has done the act
of negation remains, and thus we come to a kind of ‘being’,
and not ‘non-being’.
That is why we are advised to entertain the attitude of
being, and this attitude gives comfort: the last item of
existence which is identical with the bottom of our being, is
Reality. That which exists is not anything which has a shape
or form. They do not give satisfaction.
We have no real kinship with objects, which fact is
disclosed when they desert us without notice. And so we
are not finally satisfied with anything in the world, though
tentatively we shake hands with them. That which is in real
kinship with us, becomes us. The spirit cries for a supreme
satisfaction. All beings run after that Being of being:
satyasya-satyam. We all rush towards It, running in all
directions, seeking It and asking for It from everything that
comes across. But all give us a negative reply; no one can
help us as no one has seen It.
All our searching in objects for this Reality is only an
experimentation; and the answer is always negative because
It is not there—outside you—in objects. You carry It with
170

you always. It is the greatest negation, objectively; but
subjectively, It is the Supreme Being or Absolute Existence
which is the negation of everything external, of everything
outside Brahman. So astitva or be-ness is the final resort of
consciousness, and this is what consciousness realises in
meditation. Chit becomes sat—this is the essence. As water
enters water, or milk gets poured into milk, consciousness
mixes with being in highest meditation. Hence it is not
existence of this or that object, but even of the relations that
exist between them. This is the positive advice in this
Upanishad: “Hold onto being in meditation!”
astīty evopalabdhavyas tattva-bhāvena cobhayoḥ,
astīty evopalabdhasya tattva-bhāvaḥ prasīdati. (13)

“He should be realised as existent, and then in His
transcendental nature. When He is apprehended as
existent, His real nature becomes clear.”
Mantras twelve and thirteen are difficult to understand.
If you must choose between being and non-being, it is
better to hold onto being, because if we persist on that
thought, Truth will reveal itself. This hints at the highest
Upanishadic meditation which to achieve all study is done.
How you are to meditate on Reality is here defined.
Being is Reality; sat is the same as chit. The sat or being
which we are to meditate upon is not of objects. It is the
great being which sets aside all externality. It is general
existence, including your existence. It is not someone
meditating on something else. It is not you meditating on
God. You become a part of that on which you meditate,
because you are part of the general existence. It is difficult
to explain what it is, but it becomes easy in actual practice.
Thus this all-inclusive meditation is jnana-marga, where
171

you are face to face with God immediately. Here, you do
not meditate on forms, because your form is merged in
God—you meditate on Existence.
Requires Sincere Renunciation of All Desires
and Attachments
yadā sarve pramucyante kāmā ye’sya hṛdi śritāḥ,
atha martyo’mṛto bhavatyatra brahma samaśnute. (14)

Again a warning: if you have unfulfilled desires in your
heart, you cannot succeed in meditation. “When all desires
from the heart are cast aside, you enter Brahman here itself;
the mortal becomes immortal.”
Our difficulties and problems are self-made, caused by
desires. We intellectually crave for Reality; emotionally, we
crave for the world. This predicament is beautifully
depicted in this mantra. It is no use saying “I have no
desires,” because they are not merely in the conscious level
of the mind. They are also buried in the subconscious. In
your dreams you can sometimes see what desires you have.
When you are in a good position socially and economically,
everything appears to be fine, and you seem to be desireless.
But when you are thrown to the winds, when everything
goes dead wrong with you and when you feel like dying, the
truth comes up. These deep-lurking desires have to be cast
out. Then we can meditate as mentioned here, and then we
will get Brahman. Here itself Brahman is attained, and the
mortal becomes immortal when all desires are cast out.
yadā sarve prabhidyante hṛdayasyeha granthayaḥ,
atha martyo’mṛto bhavaty etāvad anuśāsanam. (15)

Here, the teaching is concluded. This is the instruction:
172

“When the knots of the heart are broken asunder, the
mortal becomes immortal. This is the teaching.” The knots
of the heart are avidya, kama and karma. The ignorance
which screens ourselves from Reality is avidya; the desire
that arises for objects on account of avidya is kama; and the
daily activities due to kama are karma, by which we are tied
down to mortal existence. When these are rent asunder, the
mortal becomes immortal. There is nothing more to say.
The Upanishadic teaching concludes with this mantra.
The knots of the heart are those centres of bondage which
limit consciousness to the body and earthly existence
because they limit it and its sphere of activity. While
consciousness is infinite, they bind it to finitude.
These knots are identified with certain psychic centres
called chakras, which special mention is made of brahmagranthi, rudra-granthi and vishnu-granthi. Philosophically
and mystically speaking, they refer to avidya, kama and
karma. Consciousness is tied with a threefold knot, thus
being firmly fastened to world- perception rather than
God-consciousness. To pierce these three is the real
tripura- samhara, the feat which Lord Shiva accomplished.
Nobody but He could destroy these three asuras. Likewise,
we have these three knots and not any weapon will be of
any avail in destroying them. They are supposed to be made
of gold, silver and iron—sattva, rajas and tamas. They are
our internal structure and psychic problems by which we
are made finite. Just as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva had to
concentrate their efforts to destroy the three asuras, a
tremendous effort is necessary to pierce them. The three are
inseparable from one another. They work together jointly,
like the creating, preserving and transforming powers of
173

Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva; Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Durga
have to work together. These knots cannot be manipulated.
Most people do not even know that they exist. We cannot
visualise them; they are so near to us. They cannot be
separated from our normal consciousness and distorted;
just as when we see through spectacles, we see objects but
not the spectacles themselves.
Oblivion of God, desire to acquire things and
consequent action all take place simultaneously.
Extraordinary precautions have to be taken by seekers who
undertake to destroy them; ordinary intelligence is of no
avail.
It is at this point that people realise that the difficulty is
within rather than outside. Most find fault with external
circumstances, saying that the world is wretched and things
and circumstances are not conducive. They feel that there is
nothing wrong inside. But a complete turning of the table is
necessary. Things are all right! Only, something is wrong
with us; inside us. Our difficulties are personal,
psychological and purely individual. Strictly speaking, we
are a bundle of ignorance, desire and action, and
consciousness has to struggle hard to get outside these.
The method is meditation as prescribed earlier. When
this is done, there is at once a transformation of mortal
consciousness to immortality. Nothing further is to be said.
Now follows a concluding set of three mantras which
do not add any new knowledge, but only form the
conclusion.
Seeking the Self
śataṁ caikā ca hṛdayasya nāḍyas tāsām mῡrdhānam
abhiniḥsṛtaikā:
174

tayordhvam āyann amṛtatvam eti, viṣvaṅṅ anyā utkramaṇe
bhavanti. (16)

Some sort of relation can be established between
mantras fifteen and sixteen: while the former mentions the
three knots, the latter mentions the nadis that emanate
from the three knots. “There are a hundred and one
currents of the heart, called nadis. One of them rises up to
the crown of the head. By passing through that, one
becomes immortal. But by passing through any other, one
becomes fit for rebirth in some other realm.” Also in the
Yoga Shastras it is said that internal to and pervading the
physical body, which is constituted of flesh, muscles, blood
and bones, we have a set of subtle tubes called nadis. They
are subtler than the nerves referred to in modern
physiology. Some Upanishads say that there are seventytwo thousand of them, and that their width is that of a hair
split into hundred parts. It is through them that the prana
moves, just as electricity passes through a wire. There is no
part of the body where one or the other of them is not
present. It is also said that we have seventy-two thousand
hairs or pores on our body, though no one has counted
them. These nadis form the connecting link between the
physical and subtle body; thus they are psycho-physical in
nature.
Of all these, a hundred and one are very important, the
most important ones being three. They are ida, pingala and
sushumna. The latter is the central nerve-current, and
generally it does not function; either ida or pingala do,
which are also called chandra-nadi and surya-nadi, the
cooling and heating current respectively, flowing through
the left and right nostril. These three nadis are indicators of
175

our psychological condition too. We should not allow only
one of them to work throughout the day.
So yogins influence their flow, but this is only a lower
aspect of their function. In the Upanishad, we are
concerned with the higher ones. Ida and pingala bring
about world-consciousness. The sun and moon represent
their two poles, and we roam between them. But when the
energy is made to move through sushumna to the crown of
the head, the right and left nostril cease to function, and
breath-retention takes place. By the artificial method of
kumbhaka, we force the prana in a physical way upwards.
The Tantra and Hatha Yogas are concerned with this
aspect, as against the psychological and spiritual ones of
meditation in the Upanishads. The prana is made to flow
through the central sushumna by pranayama, by exerting
pressure on the muladhara-chakra and by bandha-traya.
When this is done protractedly, heat is created, which
causes the rushing up of energy. This is a very difficult
process and is not advised for an impure mind. The
technique is all right, but the person has to be very cautious.
He should be without worldly cravings.
This sushumna is the trunk of which many nadis ramify
in all directions, just as the branches of a tree shoot out
variously. When the time of death comes, what happens?
The outer form of our system is a mixture of the five
elements. Internal to it are the nadis. Internal to the nadis is
the energy or vitality. And internal to these is the mind,
internal to which is consciousness. There is a tremendous
shake up of all five koshas at the time of death. What passes
on is not consciousness as such, because that is everywhere.
What passes is the mind.
176

Mind and intelligence, when they are animated by
consciousness, make the jiva, and when we talk of death we
are concerned with the jiva. Consciousness cannot move,
but mind does. And when it seeks an exit, if it passes
through the sushumna-nadi, it reaches immortality because
of having brought about a balance. When the mind passes
through sushumna, there is neither inspiration nor
expiration. Whenever we are world or object-conscious, we
are distracted. Just as the condition of the world is indicated
by the position of the planets, the condition of the whole
human system is indicated by the flow of breath.
Sometimes we breathe slowly, sometimes fast, etc. The
svara-shastra deals with this subject. The breathing process
is an indication of our mental condition also. We are
therefore not so much concerned with breath but with the
cause behind it. So all the physical controls cannot directly
help in God-realisation, as the process of breathing outside
is connected with the mind inside.
It is very difficult to say what enters the sushumna—it
not being air but prana, which is energy. It is a peculiar
admixture of the psycho-physical force, the total force in
the body, which is called jiva. It is this jiva that finds its exit
through sushumna. And when this happens there is a
harmony of consciousness, which is called samadhi. When
there is world or body-consciousness, we are out of balance.
Samadhi is equilibrium of consciousness between the
subject and the object. The Yoga Vasistha says that our
body is made up of mind only, and that we are under the
illusion of it being a hard object, even as we are in dream
when we see hard objects while they are not really there. In
the proportionate state of samadhi, the body gets
177

evaporated into consciousness. So if one passes away
through sushumna, he becomes immortal, because there is
samadhi at once. But if he goes through other nadis, the
soul has to take rebirth.
aṅgusṭhamātraḥ puruṣo’ntarātmā sadā janānām hṛdaye
sanniviṣṭaḥ,
taṁ svāc charīrāt pravṛhen muñjād iveṣīkāṁ dhairyeṇa,
taṁ vidyāc chukram amṛtaṁ taṁ vidyāc chukram amṛtaṁ iti.
(17)

“The purusha, of the size of a thumb, dwells always in
the heart of men. Him one should draw out from the body,
as the stalk from a blade of grass. Him one should know as
the Pure, the Immortal.” Consciousness is compared to the
purusha of the size of a thumb. This is for the sake of
concentration and meditation. In relation to His entry into
various beings, this universal Self appears to be of the size
of a thumb; and He is in all.
This consciousness is to be separated from the body,
like separating the pith of the munja grass or the plantain
stem from its outer covering, as is done in various rituals;
the covering is to be removed. Likewise, the body is to be
isolated from consciousness; and this consciousness is to be
concentrated on itself; then it becomes immortal. “Know
this to be the Pure, Immortal—know this to be the Pure,
Immortal.” This is the teaching of the Upanishad.
This Teaching: A Way to Immortality
mṛtyu-protāṁ naciketo’tha labdhvā vidyām etām yogavidhiṁ ca kṛtsnam,
brahmaprāpto virajo’bhῡd vimṛtyur anyopy evam yo vid
adhyātmam eva. (18)
178

This is something like the last Verse of the Gita:
“Having received this wisdom, as well as the rule of yoga
from Yama, Nachiketas attained Brahman, having been
freed from impurities and death. And so will any other who
has this knowledge of the inmost Self.”
This is brahma-vidya and yoga-shastra—having
attained this in its totality and completeness from Yama,
Nachiketas attained Brahman, because he was free from all
desires. This practice of yoga, knowledge of Brahman and
freedom from death is a universal truth. As Nachiketas
attained, so can any other.
To this adhyatma-vidya, you take the totality of your
being. It is the supreme vidya, because while all others give
knowledge of things in relation to space and time, in
adhyatma-vidya we gain knowledge of the Absolute Self, or
ishvara. Having thus been freed from rajas and tamas,
desire and the impulse to selfish action, one reaches
Brahman.

FIRST CHAPTER
FIRST VALLI
Prologue: Nachiketas Devoted to Death
Background...
ॐ उशन ् ह वै वाजश्रवसः सवर्वेदसं ददौ।
तस्य ह न�चकेता नाम पुत्र आस॥१॥

uśan ha vai vājaśravasaḥ sarva-vedasaṁ dadau:
tasya ha naciketā nāma putra āsa. (1)

Once, desirous of heaven, the son of Vajasravasa
(Gautama) gave (in a sacrifice) all that he possessed. He had
a son Nachiketas by name. (I.1.1)
तँ ह कुमारँ सन्तं दिक्शणासु

नीयमानासु श्रद्धा�ववेश सोऽमन्यत॥२॥
taṁ ha kumāraṁ santaṁ dakṣiṇāsu nīyamānāsu śraddhāviveśa, so’manyata. (2)

When the presents were being distributed, filial anxiety
(about the welfare of his father) entered into the heart of
Nachiketas, who was still a boy, and he thought. (I.1.2)
Nachiketas thought...
पीतोदका जग्धतण

अनन्दा नाम ते लोकास्तान ् स गच्छ�त ता ददत॥३॥
्

pītodakā jagdha-tṛṇā dugdhadohā nirindriyāḥ

181

Joyless verily are those worlds to which a man goes by
giving (presents in a sacrifice) cows which have drunk
water, eaten grass, given their milk and are barren. (I.1.3)
Nachiketas and his father...
स होवाच �पतरं तत कस्मै मां दास्यसी�त।

द्�वतीयं तत

sa hovāca pitaram, tāta kasmai māṁ dāsyasīti;
dvitīyaṁ tṛtīyam; taṁ hovāca: mṛtyave tvā dadāmīti. (4)

O father, to whom wilt thou give me? He said this again
and for the third time, the (enraged) father said: To Death I
will give thee. (I.1.4)
Nachiketas reflects...
बहूनामे�म प्रथमो बहूनामे�म मध्यमः।
�कँ िस्वद्यमस्य कतर्व्यं यन्मयाऽद्य क�रष्य�त॥५॥
bahῡnām emi prathamaḥ, bahῡnām emi madhyamaḥ;
kiṁ svid yamasya kartavyam yan mayādya kariṣyati. (5)

Among many I go as the first; among many I go in the
middle. What will be the work of Yama which today he has
to do unto me? (I.1.5)
Nachiketas...
अनुपश्य यथा पूव� प्र�तपश्य तथाऽपरे ।

anupaśya yathā pῡrve pratipaśya tathāpare,
sasyam iva martyaḥ pacyate sasyam ivajāyate punaḥ. (6)

Remember how our forefathers acted; consider also
how others now act. Like corn, the mortal decays and like
182

corn he is born again. (Nachiketas entered into the abode of
Yama Vaivasvata. There was no one to receive him. Yama
had gone out.) (I.1.6)

Hope, expectation, company with good men, friendly

are destroyed in the case of the ignorant man, in whose
house a brahmin guest stays without taking food. (I.1.8)

In the heaven there is no fear; thou art not there, O
Death, and no one is afraid on account of old age. Having
conquered both hunger and thirst, one rejoices in heaven,
being above sorrow. (I.1.12)

I will tell thee well, learn it from me, O Nachiketas. I
know the fire that leads to heaven; know the fire which
leads to heaven (which is the cause of acquiring infinite
worlds), and which again is the support of the universe and
which is seated in the cavity (of the heart). (I.1.14)

Yama then explained to him that fire-sacrifice, the
source of the worlds, what bricks are required for the altar,
how many and how they are to be placed, and Nachiketas
repeated all as explained. Then Yama, being pleased with
him, said again. (I.1.15)
तमब्रवीत ् प्रीयमाणो महात्मा वरं तवेहाद्य ददा�म भूयः।

Satisfied, magnanimous Death spoke to him: I give thee
here this other boon, this fire-sacrifice shall be named after
thee, and take thou this many-coloured chain. (I.1.16)
�त्रणा�चकेतिस्त्र�भरे त्य सिन्धं �त्रकमर्कृत्तर�त जन्ममत्ृ यू।

Whoever performs three times this sacrifice of
Nachiketas fire and has been united with the three (father,
mother and teacher) and has performed the three duties
(study, sacrifice and alms-giving) overcomes birth and
187

death. When he has understood this adorable bright, the
omniscient fire born of Brahman and realised him, then he
obtains everlasting peace. (I.1.17)
�त्रणा�चकेतस्त्रयमेतद्�व�दत्वा य एवं �वद्वाँिश्चनत

He who knows the three Nachiketa fires, and
propitiates the Nachiketa fire with this knowledge, throws
off the chains of death, goes beyond sorrow and rejoices in
heaven. (I.1.18)
एष तेऽिग्ननर्�चकेतः स्वग्य� यमवण

This, O Nachiketas, is thy fire which leads to heaven
and which thou hast chosen as thy second boon; people will
call this fire thine alone. Choose now, O Nachiketas, thy
third boon. (I.1.19)
Nachiketas’s Third Wish

There is that doubt when a man is dead, some say he is
and some he is not this I should like to know, taught by
thee. This is the third of my boons. (I.1.20)

On this point even the gods of olden times had doubt.
Verily it is not easy to understand it—subtle is its nature. O
Nachiketas, choose another boon; do not press me on this;
give this up for me. (I.1.21)
This Knowledge is Prefereable to
the Greatest Earthly Pleasures
Nachiketas...

189

Thou sayest, O Death, that even the gods had doubts
here and that this is not easy to know. Another teacher like
thee is not to be found; surely, there is no other boon like
this. (I.1.22)

If you can think of any boon equal to that, choose
wealth and long life. Be a king, O Nachiketas, of the wide
earth, I shall make thee the enjoyer of all desires. (I.1.24)

Whatever desires are difficult to attain in the world of
mortals, ask for them according to thy wish. These fair
maidens with their chariots and musical instruments—such
are indeed not enjoyable by mortals; be attended by them, I
will give them to thee; but, O Nachiketas! Do not ask the
question of the state of the Soul after death. (I.1.25)
Nachiketas...

(26)

These things last till tomorrow (ephemeral). O Death,
they wear out the vigour of all the senses. Even the longest
life is verily short. Keep thou thy chariots, the dance and
music. (I.1.26)
न �वत्तेन तपर्णीयो मनुष्यो लप्स्यामहे �वत्तमद्राक्श्म चेत्त्वा।

(27)
191

No man can be made happy by wealth. If we should
obtain wealth and behold thee, we would only live as long
as thou shalt sway. Only that boon which I have chosen is
fit to be longed by me. (I.1.27)
अजीयर्ताममत

(28)

What decaying mortal living in the world below and
possessed of knowledge, after having approached the
company of the undecaying and the immortal, will rejoice
in long life, after he has pondered over the nature of the
pleasures produced by song and sport (beauty and love)?
(I.1.28)

O Death! Tell us that in which men have this doubt, and
which is about the great hereafter. Nachiketas does not
choose any other boon but that (concerning the soul) of
which the knowledge is hidden. (I.1.29)

SECOND VALLI
The Two Ways: The Good and the Pleasant
Yama...
अन्यच्छ्रे योऽन्यदत

sinītaḥ:
tayoḥ śreya ādadānasya sādhu bhavati, hīyate’rthād ya u
preyo vṛṇīte. (1)

One is good, while another is pleasant. These two
having different objects chain a man. Blessed is he who,
between them chooses the good alone, but he who chooses
what is pleasant, loses the true end. (I.2.1)
श्रेयश्च प्रेयश्च मनुष्यमेतः तौ सम्पर�त्य �व�वनिक्त धीरः।
श्रेयो �ह धीरोऽ�भ प्रेयसो वण
ृ ीते प्रेयो मन्दो

śreyaś ca preyaś ca manuṣyam etas tau samparītya vivinakti
dhīraḥ.
śreyo hi dhīro’bhipreyaso vṛṇīte, preyo mando yoga-kṣemād
vṛṇīte. (2)

The good and the pleasant take hold of man; the wise
man examines and distinguishes them. The wise man
prefers the good (sreyas) to the pleasant, but the ignorant
man chooses the pleasant (preyas) for the sake of the body.
(I.2.2)

193

O Nachiketas, thou hast renounced objects of desires
(such as sons and grandsons) and desirable objects of
pleasant shape (as the heavenly nymphs), judging them by
their real value. Thou hast not chosen the road of wealth, in
which many men perish. (I.2.3)
दरू मेते �वपर�ते �वषूची अ�वद्या या च �वद्ये�त �ाता।

dῡram ete viparīte visūcī, avidyā yā ca vidyeti jñātā:
vidyābhīpsinaṁ naciketasam manye, na tvā kāmā bahavo
lolupantaḥ. (4)

These two, ignorance and knowledge, are wide apart
and lead to different points or goals. I believe Nachiketas to
be one who desires for knowledge, for even many desires
have not shaken thee. (I.2.4)
अ�वद्यायामन्तरे वतर्मानाः स्वयं धीराः पिण्डतंमन्यमानाः।

दन्द्रम्यमाणाः प�रयिन्त मूढा अन्धेनैव नीयमाना यथान्धाः॥५॥

194

dandramyamāṇāḥ pariyanti mῡdhāḥ, andhenaiva nīyamānā
yathāndhāḥ. (5)

The ignorant, who live in the midst of darkness but
fancy themselves as wise and learned, go round and round
deluded in many crooked ways, as blind people led by the
blind. (I.2.5)
Heedlessness, the Cause of Rebirth
न साम्परायः प्र�तभा�त बालं प्रमाद्यन्तं �वत्तमोहे न मढ

na sāmparāyaḥ pratibhāti bālam pramādyantaṁ vittamohena mῡḍham:
ayaṁ loko nāsti para iti mānī, punaḥ punar vaśam āpadyate
me. (6)

The way to the hereafter is not apparent to the ignorant
man who is foolish, deluded by the delusion of wealth. ‘This
is the world,’ he thinks, ‘there is no other’—thus he falls
again and again under my sway. (I.2.6)
श्रवणाया�प बहु�भय� न लभ्यः शण्ृ वन्तोऽ�प बहवो यं न �वद्यःु ।

na vidyuḥ
āścaryo vaktā kuśalo’sya labdhā, āścaryo jñātā
kuśalānuśiṣṭaḥ. (7)

He (the Self) of whom many are not even able to hear,
whom many, even when they hear of him, do not
comprehend; wonderful is a man, when found, who is able
195

to teach the Self; wonderful is he who comprehends the
Self, when taught by an able teacher. (I.2.7)
न नरे णावरे ण प्रोक्त एष सु�व�ेयो बहुधा �चन्त्यमानः।

na nareṇāvareṇa proktā eṣa suvijñeyo bahudhā cintyamānaḥ:
ananya-prokte gatir atra nāsty aṇīyān hy atarkyam
aṇupramānāt. (8)

That Self, when taught by a man of inferior intellect is
not easy to be known, as it is to be thought of in various
ways. But when it is taught by a preceptor who is one with
Brahman than the subtle, and is not to be obtained by
arguing. (I.2.8)
न नरे णावरे ण प्रोक्त एष सु�व�ेयो बहुधा �चन्त्यमानः।

preṣṭha:
yāṁ tvam āpas satyadhritir batāsi; tvādṛṅ no bhῡyān
naciketaḥ praṣṭā. (9)

This knowledge is not to be obtained by argument, but
it is easy to understand it, O dearest, when taught by a
teacher who beholds no difference; thou hast obtained it
now; thou art fixed in truth. May we have, O Nachiketas, an
enquirer like thee! (I.2.9)

I know that the treasure is transient, for that eternal is
not obtained by things which are not eternal. Therefore, the
Nachiketa fire has been propitiated by me with the
perishable things and I have obtained the eternal. (I.2.10)

The end of all desires, the foundation of the world, the
endless rewards of sacrifice, the other shore where there is
no fear, the praiseworthy, the great, the wide-extended
sphere and the abode of the soul—all these thou hast seen,
and being wise, O Nachiketas, thou hast with firm resolve
rejected all. (I.2.11)

The wise sage who, by means of meditation on his Self,
recognises the ancient, who is difficult to be seen, who is
unfathomable and concealed, who is hidden in the cave of
the heart, who dwells in the abyss, who is lodged in
intelligence, indeed renounces joy and sorrow. (I.2.12)

Having heard and well grasped this (the Self), the
mortal, abstracting the virtuous Atman, attaining this
subtle Self, rejoices, because he has obtained what is cause
for rejoicing. I think that the abode of Brahman is wide
open for Nachiketas. (I.2.13)

The goal (word) which all the vedas speak of (praise),
which all penances proclaim and wishing for which they
lead the life of a brahmacharin, that goal (word) I will
briefly tell thee—It is Om. (I.2.15)

This is the best support. This is the highest support. He
who knows this support is worshipped in the world of
Brahman. (I.2.17)
The Eternal Indestructable Soul

(18)

The intelligent Atman is not born, nor does He die; He
did not spring from anything, and nothing sprang from
Him; unborn, eternal, everlasting, ancient, He is not slain
although the body is slain. (I.2.18)
हन्ता चेन्मन्यते हन्तँु हतश्चेन्मन्यते हतम।्

hantā cen manyate hantuṁ hataś cen manyate hatam,

If the slayer thinks ‘I slay,’ if the slain thinks, ‘I am
slain,’ then both of them do not know well. This slays not,
nor is slain. (I.2.19)

The Atman, subtler than the subtle, greater than the
great, is seated in the heart of each living being. He who is
free from desire, with his mind and the senses composed,
beholds the majesty of the Self and becomes free from
sorrow. (I.2.20)

This Atman cannot be attained by study of the vedas,
nor by intelligence, nor by much hearing. He whom the Self
chooses, by him the Self can be gained. To him this Atman
reveals Its true nature. (I.2.23)
ना�वरतो दश्ु च�रतान्नाशान्तो नासमा�हतः।

्
nāvirato duścaritān nāśānto nāsamāhitaḥ

But he who has not turned away from bad conduct,
whose senses are not subdued, whose mind is not
concentrated, whose mind is not pacified, can never obtain
this Atman by knowledge. (I.2.24)
यस्य ब्रह्म च क्शत्रं च उभे भवत ओदनः।

Of whom, the brahmana and the kshatriya classes are
(as it were) but food, and Death itself a condiment (or
pickle), how can one thus know where that Atman is?

THIRD VALLI
Two Selves: The Universal and Individual Soul
Yama...
ऋतं �पबन्तौ सुकृतस्य लोके गुहां प्र�वष्टौ परमे पराध�।

छायातपौ ब्रह्म�वदो वदिन्त पञ्चाग्नयो ये च �त्रणा�चकेताः॥१॥
ṛtam pibantau sukṛtasya loke guhām praviṣṭau parame
parārdhe,
chāyā-tapau brahma-vido vadanti, pañcāgnayo ye ca triṇāciketāḥ. (1)

The two who enjoy the fruits of their good works being
seated in the cavity of the seat of the Supreme, the knowers
of Brahman call them shadow and light, as also the
performers of the fivefold fire and those who have
propitiated three times the Nachiketa fire. (I.3.1)
The Nachiketas Sacrificial Fire as an Aid
यः सेतुर�जानानामक्शरं ब्रह्म यत ् परम।्

अभयं �ततीषर्तां पारं ना�चकेतँ शकेम�ह॥२॥

yas setur ījānānām akṣaram brahma yat param,
abhayam titīrṣatām pāram nāciketaṁ śakemahi. (2)

We are able to understand both, the Nachiketa fire
which is the bridge of all sacrifices (to cross misery) and
also the highest, indestructible Brahman, fearless and the
refuge for those who wish to cross the ocean of samsara.
(I.3.2)

203

Parable of the Individual Soul in a Chariot
Yama...
आत्मानँ र�थतं �व�द्ध शर�रँ रथमेव त।ु

ātmānaṁ rathinaṁ viddhi, śarīraṁ rathameva tu:
buddhiṁ tu sāradhiṁ viddhi, manaḥ pragraham eva ca. (3)

Know the Atman as the Lord of the chariot, the body as
the chariot; know the intellect as the charioteer and the
mind again as the reins. (I.3.3)
इिन्द्रया�ण हयानाहु�वर्षयाँ स्तेषु गोचरान।्

indriyāṇi hayān āhur viṣayāṁs teṣu gocarān,
ātmendriya-mano-yuktam bhoktety āhur manīṣiṇaḥ. (4)

They say, the senses are the horses and their objects are
the roads; the Atman, the senses and the mind united, the
wise call the enjoyer. (I.3.4)
यस्त्व�व�ानवान्भवत्ययुक्तेन मनसा सदा।

तस्येिन्द्रयाण्यवश्या�न दष्ु टाश्वा इव सारथेः॥५॥
yas tv avijñānavān bhavaty ayuktena manasā sadā,
tasyendriyāṇy avaśyāni duṣṭāśvā iva sāratheḥ. (5)

He who has no discrimination and whose mind is
always uncontrolled, his senses are not controllable like
vicious horses of a driver. (I.3.5)
यस्तु �व�ानवान्भव�त युक्तेन मनसा सदा।

तस्येिन्द्रया�ण वश्या�न सदश्वा इव सारथेः॥६॥

yas tu vijñānavān bhavati, yuktena manasā sadā,
204

tasyendriyāṇi vaśyāni sadaśvā iva sāratheḥ. (6)

But he who has understanding and whose mind is
always controlled, his senses are under control like good
horses of a driver. (I.3.6)
Intelligent Control of the Soul's Chariot Necessary
यस्त्व�व�ानवान्भवत्यमनस्कः सदाऽशु�चः।

न स तत्पदमाप्नो�त संसारं चा�धगच्छ�त॥७॥
yas tv avijñānavān bhavaty amanaskas sadā’śuciḥ
na sa tat padam āpnoti saṁsāraṁ cādhigacchati. (7)

But he, who has no discrimination, and whose mind is
not under control, and who is always impure, does not
reach that goal, but enters into the round of births and
deaths. (I.3.7)
यस्तु �व�ानवान्भव�त समनस्कः सदा शु�चः।

स तु तत्पदमाप्नो�त यस्माद्भूयो न जायते॥८॥
yas tu vijñānavān bhavati samanaskas sadā śuciḥ,
sa tu tat padam āpnoti yasmāt bhῡyo na jāyate. (8)

But he, who has understanding, who has his mind
always under control, and who is pure, reaches that goal
whence he is not born again. (I.3.8)
�व�ानसार�थयर्स्तु मनः प्रग्रहवान्नरः।

सोऽध्वनः पारमाप्नो�त तद्�वष्णोः परमं पदम॥९॥
्
vijñānasārathir yastu manaḥ pragrahavān naraḥ,
so’dhvanaḥ param āpnoti tad viṣṇoḥ paramam padam. (9)

205

But he who has discerning intelligence as the driver and
a well-controlled mind as the reins, reaches the end of his
journey, that highest place of Vishnu. (I.3.9)
The Order of Progression to the Supreme
Yama...
इिन्द्रयेभ्यः परा ह्यथार् अथ�भ्यश्च परं मनः।

मनसस्तु परा बु�द्धबद्ध
ुर् ेरात्मा महान्परः॥१०॥

indriyebhyaḥ parā hy arthā, arthebhyaś ca param manaḥ,
manasaś ca parā buddhir buddher ātmā mahān paraḥ. (10)

Beyond the senses are the rudiments of objects, beyond
these rudiments is the mind, beyond the mind is the
intellect, beyond the intellect is the great Self. (I.3.10)
महतः परमव्यक्तमव्यक्तात्पुरुषः परः।

पुरुषान्न परं �कं�चत्सा काष्ठा सा परा ग�तः॥११॥

mahataḥ param avyaktam, avyaktāt puruṣaḥ paraḥ
puruṣān na paraṁ kiñcit: sā kāṣṭhā sā parā gatiḥ. (11)

Beyond the great (mahat) is the unmanifested
(avyakta). Beyond the avyakta is the Purusha, beyond the
Purusha there is nothing, that is the end, that is the highest
goal. (I.3.11)
The Method of Yoga
Yama...
एष सव�षु भत

206

This Atman is hidden in all beings and does not shine
forth, but it is seen by subtle seers through their sharp and
subtle intellect. (I.3.12)
यच्छे द्वाङ्मनसी प्रा�स्तद्यच्छे ज्�ान आत्म�न।

�ानमात्म�न मह�त �नयच्छे त्तद्यच्छे च्छान्त आत्म�न॥१३॥
yacched vāṅ manasī prājñas tad yacchej jñāna-ātmani
jñānam ātmani mahati niyacchet, tad yacchec chāntavātmani. (13)

Let the wise sink his speech into the mind, the mind
into the intellect and the intellect into the great Atman and
the great Atman into the peaceful Atman. (I.3.13)
Exhortation and Call to
the Way of Liberation from Death
उित्तष्ठत जाग्रत प्राप्य वरािन्नबोधत।

Arise, awake, having reached the great (teachers), learn
(realise that Atman). Like the sharp edge of a razor is that
path, difficult to cross and hard to tread—thus the wise say.
(I.3.14)
अशब्दमस्पशर्मरूपमव्ययं तथाऽरसं �नत्यमगन्धवच्च यत।्

anādy anantam mahataḥ paraṁ dhruvaṁ nicāyya tam mṛtyumukhāt pramucyate. (15)

He, who has known that which is without sound,
without touch, without form, without decay, without taste,
eternal, without smell, without beginning, without end,
beyond the mahat (great) and unchanging, is freed from
the jaws of death. (I.3.15)
The Immortal Value of this Teaching
Narration...

nāciketam upākhyānam mṛtyu-proktaṁ sanātanam

A wise man who hears and repeats the ancient story of
Nachiketas told by Yama, attains glory in the world of
Brahman. (I.3.16)
य इमं परमं गह्

Whoever with devotion recites before an assembly of
brahmins or at the time of sraaddha of forefathers, this
highest secret, obtains thereby immortality, obtains
immortality. (I.3.17)

SECOND CHAPTER
FIRST VALLI
The Self is Not to be Sought Through the Senses
Yama...

nāntarātman:
kaś cid dhīraḥ pratyag-ātmānam aikṣad āvṛtta-cakṣur amṛtatvam icchan. (1)

The self-existent (Brahma) created the senses with
outgoing tendencies; therefore man beholds the external
universe and not the internal Self (Atman). But, some wise
man with eyes averted from sensual objects (with his senses
turned away), desirous of Immortality, sees the Atman
within). (II.1.1)
पराचः कामाननुयिन्त बाला-स्ते मत्ृ योयर्िन्त �वततस्य पाशम।्

pāśam,

The ignorant run after external objects of desire and fall
into the snares of widespread death, but wise men, knowing
the nature of Immortality, do not covet the fleeting
(unstable) things here. (II.1.2)
210

Yet the Agent in All the Senses in All Conditions
येन रूपं रसं गन्धं शब्दान ् स्पशार्श्च मैथन

्
yena rῡpaṁ gandhaṁ śabdān sparśāṁś ca maithunān,
etenaiva vijānāti, kim atra pariśiṣyate: etad vai tat. (3)

To the Self by which one knows form, taste, smell,
sound, touch and the sexual pleasure, nothing remains
unknown. This verily is That (Brahman which thou hast
asked for). (II.1.3)
स्वप्नान्तं जाग�रतान्तं चोभौ येनानुपश्य�त।

महान्तं �वभुमात्मानं मत्वा धीरो न शोच�त॥४॥
svapnāntaṁ jāgaritāntaṁ cobhau yenānupaśyati,
mahāntaṁ vibhumātmānam matvā dhīro na śocati. (4)

The wise, when he knows that by which he perceives all
objects in dream or in waking is the great omnipresent
Atman, grieves no more. (II.1.4)
The Universal Soul is Identical
with the Individual Soul
Yama...
य इमं मध्वदं वेद आत्मानं जीवमिन्तकात।्

ईशानं भूतभव्यस्य न ततो �वजुगुप्सते। एतद्वै तत॥५॥
्
ya imam madhvadaṁ veda ātmānaṁ jīvam antikāt,
īśāṅam bhῡta-bhavyasya, na tato vijugupsate: etad vai tat. (5)

He who knows this Atman, honey-eater, Soul, always
near and the Lord of the past and the future henceforward
fears no more. This is verily That. (II.1.5)
211

यः पूव� तपसो जातमद्भ्यः पूवम

guhām praviśya tiṣṭhantam yo bhῡtebhir vyapaśyata: etad vai
tat. (6)

Who beholds him seated within the five elements, him
who was born of tapas (of Brahman), who was created
before the waters, who entered the cave of the heart and
dwells there (he verily sees Brahman). This is verily That
(Brahman which thou hast asked for). (II.1.6)
या प्राणेन संभवत्य�द�तद� वतामयी।

गुहां प्र�वश्य �तष्ठन्तीं या भूते�भव्यर्जायत। एतद्वै तत॥७॥
्
yā prāṇena sambhavaty aditir devatāmayī,
guhām praviśya tiṣṭhantī, yā bhῡtebhir vyajāyata: etad vai
tat. (7)

Who is born along with prana in the form of all devatas,
who, entering into the heart, abides therein, and who was
born with the elements (he who knows Him, verily knows
Brahman). This is indeed That. (II.1.7)
अरण्यो�नर्�हतो जातवेदा गभर् इव सभ

araṇyor nihito jāta-vedā garbha iva subhṛto garbhiṇībhiḥ:
dive diva īḍyo jāgṛvadbhir haviṣmadbhir manuṣyebhir agniḥ:
etad vai tat. (8)

The fire that is lodged within two pieces of wood, as the
foetus is well-preserved by the pregnant woman, is
212

worshipped daily by men who are awake and those who
offer oblations. This is indeed That. (II.1.8)
यतश्चोदे �त सूय�ऽस्तं यत्र च गच्छ�त।

तं दे वाः सव�ऽ�पर्तास्तद ु नात्ये�त कश्चन। एतद्वै तत॥९॥
्
yataś codeti śuryo astam yatra ca gacchati,
taṁ devās sarve’rpitās tadu nātyeti kaś cana: etad vai tat. (9)

And that whence the sun rises, and whither it sets, on
that there all the devatas depend and no one goes beyond.
This is indeed That. (II.1.9)
Failure to Comprehend the Essential Unity of Being is
the Cause of Rebirth
Yama...
यदे वेह तदमुत्र यदमुत्र तदिन्वह।

मत्ृ योः स मत्ृ युमाप्नो�त य इह नानेव पश्य�त॥१०॥
yad eveha tad amutra yad amutra tad anviha,
mṛtyos sa mṛtyum āpnoti ya iha nāneva paśyati. (10)

What is even here (visible in the world), the same is
there (invisible in Brahman), and what is there, the same
here. He proceeds from death to death who beholds here
difference (between Brahman and the world). (II.1.10)
मनसैवेदमाप्तव्यं नेह नानाऽिस्त �कंचन।

मत्ृ योः स मत्ृ युं गच्छ�त य इह नानेव पश्य�त॥११॥
manasaivedam āptavyaṁ neha nānāsti kiñ cana:
mṛtyos sa mṛtyuṁ gacchati ya iha nāneva paśyati. (11)

213

By mind alone could this (Brahman) be obtained; then
there is no difference here at all. He goes from death to
death who sees any difference here. (II.1.11)
The Eternal Lord Abiding In One's Self
Yama...
अङ्गुष्ठमात्रः पुरुषो मध्य आत्म�न �तष्ठ�त।

ईशानं भूतभव्यस्य न ततो �वजुगुप्सते। एतद्वै तत॥१२॥
्
aṅguṣṭha-mātraḥ puruṣo madhya ātmani tiṣṭhati:
īśāno bhῡta-bhavyasya na tato vijigupsate: etad vai tat. (12)

The person (Purusha) of the size of a thumb resides in
the middle of the body, as Lord of the past and the future,
and henceforward (after knowing Him) fears no more. This
is indeed That. (II.1.12)
अङ्गुष्ठमात्रः पुरुषो ज्यो�त�रवाधम
ू कः।

ईशानो भूतभव्यस्य स एवाद्य स उ श्वः। एतद्वै तत॥१३॥
्
aṅguṣṭha-mātraḥ puruṣo jyotir ivādhῡmakaḥ,
īśāno bhῡta-bhavyasya sa evādya sa u śvaḥ: etad vai tat. (13)

That person, of the size of a thumb, is like a flame
without smoke, Lord of the past and the future. He alone is
even today, and will be verily tomorrow. This is verily That.
(II.1.13)
The Results of Seeing Diversity or Unity
Yama...

214

yathodakam durge vṛṣṭam parvateṣu vidhāvati,
evaṁ dharmān pṛthak paśyaṁs tān evānuvidhāvati. (14)

As water, when rained on a mountain-ridge, runs down
the rocks scattered on all sides, so does he, who beholds the
objects as different, run after them only on all sides.
(II.1.14)
यथोदकं शुद्धे शुद्धमा�सक्तं तादृगेव भव�त।

yathodakaṁ śuddhe śuddham āsiktaṁ tādṛg eva bhavati,
evaṁ muner vijānata ātmā bhavati gautama. (15)

As pure water poured into pure water becomes the
same only, so the Atman of the thinker who knows this,
becomes, O Gautama. (II.1.15)

्

The city of the unborn (Brahman) whose knowledge is
permanent, has eleven gates. Adoring Him one does not
grieve, and liberated (from all bonds of ignorance), he
becomes free. This verily is That. (II.2.1)

As hamsa (sun) he dwells in heaven, as vasu (air) he
dwells in the sky, as fire he dwells on the earth, as guest he
dwells in a house, he dwells in men, in gods, in truth, in
ether. He is born in the waters, he is born in the earth, he is
born in the sacrifice, he is born on the mountains, he is true
and great. (II.2.2)
ऊध्व� प्राणमुन्नयत्यपानं प्रत्यगस्य�त।

216

ῡrdhvam prāṇam unnayaty apānam pratyag asyati,
madhye vāmanam āsīnaṁ viśve devā upāsate. (3)

He (Brahman) sends up the prana and throws the
apana downwards, that adorable one seated in the centre,
all devas worship. (II.2.3)
अस्य �वस्रंसमानस्य शर�रस्थस्य दे �हनः।

्

dehād vimucyamānasya kim atra pariśiṣyate: etad vai tat. (4)

When this Atman who dwells in the body departs from
the body, what remains then? This verily is That. (II.2.4)
न प्राणेन नापानेन मत्य� जीव�त कश्चन।

इतरे ण तु जीविन्त यिस्मन्नेतावुपा�श्रतौ॥५॥
na prāṇena nāpānena martyo jīvati kaś cana,
itareṇa tu jīvanti, yasminn etāv upāśritau. (5)

Not by prana, not by apana does any mortal live, but it
is by some other on which these two depend that men live.
(II.2.5)
The Appropriate Embodiment of the Reincarnating Soul
Yama...
हन्त त इदं प्रवक्श्या�म गुह्यं ब्रह्म सनातनम।्

hanta ta idaṁ pravakṣyāmi guhyam brahma sanātanam:
yathā ca maraṇam prāpya ātmā bhavati gautama. (6)

217

Well then, O Gautama, I will explain the mysterious,
ancient Brahman and also what happens to the Self after
death. (II.2.6)

yonim anye prapadyante śarīratvāya dehinaḥ,

Some jivas enter the womb in order to have a body,
others go into the inorganic matter according to their
karma and knowledge. (II.2.7)
One's Real Self, the Same as the World-Ground
य एष सुप्तेषु जाग�तर् कामं कामं पुरुषो �न�मर्माणः।

(8)

This Purusha who, building desire after desire, is awake
when all sleep, is called certainly ‘the pure,’ is called
Brahman, is called even immortal. Upon Him all the worlds
are found: no one goes beyond that. This verily is that.
(II.2.8)

takes a form according to whatever He enters and is outside
all forms. (II.2.9)

As the one air, after it has entered the world, though
one, takes different forms according to whatever it enters,
so the internal Atman of all living beings, though one,
assumes forms, according to whatever He enters and is
outside all forms. (II.2.10)
सूय� यथा सवर्लोकस्य चक्शुः न �लप्यते चाक्शुषैबार्ह्यदोषैः।

ekas tathā sarva-bhῡtāntar-ātmā na lipyate loka-duḥkena
bāhyaḥ. (11)

As the sun, the eye of the whole world, is not
contaminated by the defects of the eye or of external things,
so the one internal Atman of all living beings, is not
contaminated by the misery of the world, being external to
it. (II.2.11)
Indescribable Bliss of Self-Realisation

He is One, the ruler, the internal Atman of all living
beings, who makes manifold His one form—those wise
men who realise Him in their hearts, to them belongs
eternal happiness and not for others. (II.2.12)
�नत्योऽ�नत्यानां चेतनश्चेतनानाम ् एको बहूनां यो �वदधा�त

vidadhāti kāmān,
tam ātmastham yenupaśyanti dhīrāḥ; teṣāṁ śāntiḥ śasvatī,

The wise who behold the Self as the eternal among the
transient, as conscious among the conscious, who, though
one, grants the desires of many, as dwelling in their own
selves, to them belongs eternal peace, not to others. (II.2.13)
Nachiketas...

tad etad iti manyante’ nirdeśyam paramaṁ sukham,
kathaṁ nu tad vijānīyām kimu bhāti vibhāti vā. (14)

They (the sages) perceive that indescribable highest
bliss as ‘This is That.’ How shall I know that? Does it shine
(of itself) or does it shine by another light? (II.2.14)
The Self-Luminous Light of the World
Yama...
न तत्र सूय� भा�त न चन्द्रतारकं नेमा �वद्युतो भािन्त

vibhāti. (15)

The sun does not shine there, nor do the moon and the
stars, nor do lightnings shine and much less this fire. When
221

He shines, everything shines after Him; by His light, all
these shine. (II.2.15)

THIRD VALLI
The World-tree Rooted in Brahman
Yama...
ऊध्वर्मूलोऽवाक् शाख एषोऽश्वत्थः सनातनः।

tad eva śukraṁ tad brahma, tad evāmṛtam ucyate,
tasmin lokāḥ śritāḥ sarve tad u nātyeti kaś cana: etad vai tat.
(1)

There is that ancient asvattha tree whose root is
upwards and branches are down. That indeed is pure. That
is Brahman and that alone is called Immortal. Upon that all
the worlds depend and no one goes beyond that. This is
verily That. (II.3.1)
The Great Fear
Yama...
य�ददं �कं च जगत ् सव� प्राण एज�त �नःसत

महद्भयं वज्रमद्

yad idaṁ kiñ ca jagat sarvam prāṇa ejati niḥsṛtam,
mahad bhayaṁ vajram udyatam, ya etad vidur amṛtās te
bhavanti. (2)
222

This whole universe evolved from Brahman, moves in
the prana (in the highest Brahman). That Brahman is a
great terror, like an uplifted thunderbolt. Those who know
this become immortal. (II.3.2)
भयादस्यािग्नस्तप�त भयात्तप�त सय

भया�दन्द्रश्च वायश्ु च मत्ृ यध

bhayād asyāgnis tapati, bhayāt tapati sῡryaḥ,
bhayād indraś ca vāyuś ca, mṛtyur dhāvati pañcamaḥ. (3)

From fear of Brahman fire burns, from fear the sun
shines, from fear Indra and Vayu and Death, the fifth, run.
(II.3.3)
Degrees of Perception of the Self
Yama...
इह चेदशकद्बोद्धुं प्राक्शर�रस्य �वस्रसः।

iha ced aśakad boddhum prāk śarīrasya visrasaḥ,
tataḥ sargeṣu lokeṣu śarīratvāya kalpate. (4)

If here (in this life) one is able to comprehend Him
(Brahman) before the death of the body, he will be liberated
from the bondage of the world; if one is not able to
comprehend Him, then he has to take a body again in the
worlds of creation. (II.3.4)
यथाऽऽदश� तथाऽऽत्म�न यथा स्वप्ने तथा �पतल
ृ ोके।
यथाऽप्सु पर�व ददृशे तथा गन्धवर्लोके

223

yathādarśe tathātmani, yathā svapne tathā pitṛ-loke,
yathāpsu parīva dadṛśe, tathā gandharva-loka chāyā-tapayor
iva brahma-loke. (5)

As in a mirror, so (Brahman can be clearly seen) here
within one’s self, as in dreams, so in the world of the
forefathers; as in water, so in the world of gandharvas; as in
light and shade, so in the world of Brahman. (II.3.5)
The Gradation Up To the Cosmic Being
इिन्द्रयाणां पथ
ृ ग्भावमुदयास्तमयौ च यत।्

पथ
ृ गुत्पद्यमानानां मत्वा धीरो न शोच�त॥६॥
indriyāṇām pṛthag-bhāvam udayāstamayau ca yat,
pṛthag utpadyamānānam matvā dhīro na śocati. (6)

A wise man, having understood that the senses
separately produced are distinct from the Atman and also
their rising and setting, grieves no more. (II.3.6)
इिन्द्रयेभ्यः परं मनो मनसः सत्त्वमुत्तमम।्

सत्त्वाद�ध महानात्मा महतोऽव्यक्तमुत्तमम॥७॥
्
indriyebhyaḥ param mano manasaṣ sattvam uttamam,
sattvād adhi mahān ātmā, mahato’vyaktam uttamam. (7)

Beyond the senses is the mind, higher than the mind is
the intellect, higher than the intellect is the great Atman,
higher than the mahat is avyaktam (the unmanifested).
(II.3.7)
अव्यक्तात्तु परः पुरुषो व्यापकोऽ�लङ्ग एव च।

यं �ात्वा मुच्यते जन्तुरमत
ृ त्वं च गच्छ�त॥८॥

avyaktāt tu paraḥ puruso vyāpako’liṅga eva ca,
yaṁ jñātvā mucyate jantur amṛtatvaṁ ca gacchati. (8)
224

Beyond the avyakta is Purusha, all-pervading and
devoid of linga (indicative sign). He who knows Him is
liberated and obtains Immortality. (II.3.8)
न संदृशे �तष्ठ�त रूपमस्य न चक्शष
ु ा पश्य�त कश्चनैनम।्

हृदा मनीषा मनसाऽ�भक्लप्ृ तो य एतद्�वदरु मत

na saṁdṛśe tiṣṭhati rῡpam asya, na cakṣuṣā paśyati
kaścanainam,
hṛdā maṇīṣā manasābhikḷpto ya etad vidur amṛtās te
bhavanti. (9)

His form is not to be seen. No one beholds Him with
the eye. By controlling the mind by the intellect and by
incessant meditation He is revealed. Those who know this
(Brahman) become immortal. (II.3.9)
The Method of Yoga
यदा पञ्चाव�तष्ठन्ते �ाना�न मनसा सह।

बु�द्धश्च न �वचेष्टते तामाहुः परमां ग�तम॥१०॥
्
yadā pañcāvatiṣṭhante jñānāni manasā saha,
buddhiś ca na viceṣṭati, tām āhuḥ paramāṃ gatim. (10)

When the five organs of knowledge are at rest together
with the mind, and when the intellect ceases functioning
(becomes calm), that they call the highest state. (II.3.10)
तां योग�म�त मन्यन्ते िस्थरा�मिन्द्रयधारणाम।्

अप्रमत्तस्तदा भव�त योगो �ह प्रभवाप्ययौ॥११॥
tām yogam iti manyante sthirām indriya-dhāraṇām
apramattas tadā bhavati, yogo hi prabhavāpyayau. (11)

225

The firm control of the senses, they regard as yoga. At
that time one gets careful, for, yoga is acquired and lost.
(II.3.11)
The Self is Existence
Yama...
नैव वाचा न मनसा प्राप्तुं शक्यो न चक्शुषा।

अस्ती�त ब्रुवतोऽन्यत्र कथं तदप
ु लभ्यते॥१२॥
naiva vācā na manasā prāptuṁ śakyo na cakṣuṣā,
astīti bruvato’nyatra kathaṁ tad upalabhyate. (12)

The Self cannot be reached by speech, by mind or by
the eye. How can it be realised otherwise than from those
who say, ‘He is?’ (II.3.12)
अस्तीत्येवोपलब्धव्यस्तत्त्वभावेन चोभयोः।

अस्तीत्येवोपलब्धस्य तत्त्वभावः प्रसीद�त॥१३॥

astīty evopalabdhavyas tattva-bhāvena cobhayoḥ,
astīty evopalabdhasya tattva-bhāvaḥ prasīdati. (13)

He should be known to exist and also as He really is. Of
these two, to him who knows Him to exist, His true nature
becomes manifest. (II.3.13)
Requires Sincere Renunciation
of All Desires and Attachments
यदा सव� प्रमच्
ु यन्ते कामा येऽस्य हृ�द �श्रताः।

अथ मत्य�ऽमत

ृ ो भवत्यत्र ब्रह्म समश्नत
yadā sarve pramucyante kāmā ye’sya hṛdi śritāḥ,
atha martyo’mṛto bhavatyatra brahma samaśnute. (14)

226

When all desires that dwell in the heart of one cease,
then the mortal becomes immortal and here attains
Brahman. (II.3.14)
यथा सव� प्र�भद्यन्ते हृदयस्येह ग्रन्थयः।

अथ मत्य�ऽमत
्

ृ ो भवत्येतावद्ध्यनश
yadā sarve prabhidyante hṛdayasyeha granthayaḥ,
atha martyo’mṛto bhavaty etāvad anuśāsanam. (15)

When all the knots of the heart are severed here on
earth, then the mortal becomes immortal, so far is the
instruction (of all vedanta). (II.3.15)
Seeking the Self
शतं चैका च हृदयस्य नाड्य-स्तासां मूधार्नम�भ�नःसत
ृ ैका।

तयोध्वर्मायन्नमत

abhiniḥsṛtaikā:
tayordhvam āyann amṛtatvam eti, viṣvaṅṅ anyā utkramaṇe
bhavanti. (16)

There are hundred and one nerves of the heart. One of
them (sushumna) penetrates the crown of the head, moving
upwards by it one (at the time of death) attaining
immortality, the other nerves are of various course. (II.3.16)
अङ्गुष्ठमात्रः पुरुषोऽन्तरात्मा सदा जनानां हृदये सं�न�वष्टः।

तं स्वाच्छर�रात्प्रवह
ृ े न्मुञ्जा�दवेषीकां धैय�ण।

227

aṅgusṭhamātraḥ puruṣo’ntarātmā sadā janānām hṛdaye

taṁ svāc charīrāt pravṛhen muñjād iveṣīkāṁ dhairyeṇa,
taṁ vidyāc chukram amṛtaṁ taṁ vidyāc chukram amṛtaṁ iti.
(17)

The Purusha of the size of a thumb, the inner Self, is
always seated in the heart of all living beings; one should
draw him out from one’s own body with steadiness, as one
draws the pith (stalk) from a reed; one should know him as
pure and immortal; one should know him as pure and
immortal. (II.3.17)

Nachiketas then having acquired this knowledge
imparted by Yama, and also the whole teaching about yoga,
attained Brahman, having become free from all impurities
and death. Thus it will be with another also, who thus
knows the nature of the Atman. (II.3.18)

This shanti mantra is an expiatory prayer. It is intended
to remove all faults incurred by the disciple and preceptor
in the course of receiving and imparting knowledge
respectively and caused by abandoning of rules due to
oversight or excitement. In order to ward off all evils the
word shantih—Peace, is repeated three times. Om Peace!
Peace! Peace! (II.3.19)
